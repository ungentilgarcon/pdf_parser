Over the past\ntwo decades, this generalised sense of a significant relationship\nbetween French identity and film has been explored in scholarly\nbooks and articles, and has entered the curriculum at university\nlevel and, in Britain, at A-level. The study of film as an art-form\nand (to a lesser extent) as industry, has become a popular and\nwidespread element of French Studies, and French cinema has\nacquired an important place within Film Studies. Meanwhile, the\ngrowth in multi-screen and \'art-house\' cinemas, together with the\ndevelopment of the video industry, has led to the greater avail-\nability of foreign-language films to an English-speaking audience.\nResponding to these developments, this series is designed for\nstudents and teachers seeking information and accessible but\nrigorous critical study of French cinema, and for the enthusiastic\nfilmgoer who wants to know more.\n   The adoption of a director-based approach raises questions\nabout auteunsm. A series that categorises films not according to\nperiod or to genre (for example), but to the person who directed\nthem, runs the risk of espousing a romantic view of film as the\nproduct of solitary inspiration. On this model, the critic\'s role might\nseem to be that of discovering continuities, revealing a necessary\n\fviii   SERIES EDITORS\' FOREWORD\n\n\ncoherent set of themes and motifs which correspond to the parti-\ncular genius of the individual. This is not our aim: the auteur\nperspective on film, itself most clearly articulated in France in the\nearly 195os, will be interrogated in certain volumes of the series,\nand, throughout, the director will be treated as one highly\nsignificant element in a complex process of film production and\nreception which includes socio-economic and political determin-\nants, the work of a large and highly skilled team of artists and\ntechnicians, the mechanisms of production and distribution, and\nthe complex and multiply determined responses of spectators.\n   The work of some of the directors in the series is already\nknown outside France, that of others is less so - the aim is both to\nprovide informative and original English-language studies of\nestablished figures, and to extend the range of French directors\nknown to anglophone students of cinema. We intend the series to\ncontribute to the promotion of the informal and formal study of\nFrench films, and to the pleasure of those who watch them.\n\n                                                     DIANA HOLMES\n                                                   ROBERT INGRAM\n\fAcknowledgements\n\n\n\nThank you to Joanne Austin, Thomas Austin, Ben Clift, Maire\nCross, Di Holmes, Dave Platten, David Walker, Julie Rene and\nLaure Boissou at the Cinematheque frans;aise, Paul Morrissey at\nTartan, and the staff at the British Film Institute stills department.\nThis book is dedicated to Thomas and Patrick.\n\f\fChabrol and friends\n\n\n\nIn the autumn of 1997, at the age of 67, Claude Chabrol released\nRien ne va plus, his fiftieth HIm. The leading French film magazine,\nCahiers du cinema, marked the occasion with a special issue\ndevoted entirely to his work. The editorial described him as \'le\ncineaste fran~ais le plus productif, et peut-etre le plus "rentable",\ndes quatre demieres decennies" (Toubiana 1997: 4). (His achieve-\nment is all the more remarkable when one notes that in recent\nyears several previously successful French film directors have\nbeen more or less obliged to abandon the cinema, including Leos\nCarax, Jean-Jacques Beineix and Bertrand Blier.) Chabrol\'s forty-\nyear career is in some ways a history of recent French cinema and\nsociety: neorealism, the new wave, the trauma of the Algerian\nWar, the political legacy of 1968, the rise of the consumer society\nand the \'pompidolien\' bourgeoisie; the perennial popularity of\nthe thriller, the tension between television and cinema, the\ndecline of Marxism. Chabrol has known periods of great success\n(the launching of the new wave in 1958, the superb Helene cycle\nof the late 1960s - including his most famous film Le Boucher-\nhis return to form in the 1990s), and also periods of inactivity and\nfailure (a year in the early 1960s without shooting a single scene, a\ngeneral loss of direction in the late 1970s). Twice he has relaunched\n\nI   \'the most prolific and perhaps the most ·profitable" French film-maker of the\n    last four decades\'\n2   That is to say, the bourgeoisie of 1969-74, the period of Georges Pompidou\'s\n    presidency.\n\f4    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nThe result is a filmography which contains turkeys (Folies bour-\ngeoises, Quiet Days in Clichy) as well as masterpieces (the Helene\ncycle, Betty, La Cirimonie) , but which is finally being recognised as\n a landmark in French cinema.\n     Typically, Chabrol\'s autobiography is published not in an auteurist\n cinema collection but in the series \'Un homme et son metier\'.9\n For him, directing is a job which can be demystified from the\n auteurist/Romantic idea of it. His concept of cinema privileges the\n spectator as well as the creator - hence the importance of genre in\n his work, since it is often via the expectations aroused by popular\n genres that a spectator approaches a given film. Rejecting the\n avant-garde and the experimental, Chabrol chooses (even when he\n doesn\'t have to, financially speaking) to work within the confines\n of established genres. In 1979 he declared that \'I\'ve always tried to\nhold on to the cinema of genre because I think it\'s the only way to\n make films. These days in France, but not only there, one veers\nmostly towards an overly intellectual vision of things, and I think\nthe only solution is to make some good policiers, some good soap-\noperas and comedies\' (Yakir 1979: 2). Chabrol has in fact filmed\nfarce (Folies bourgeoises), melodrama (La Rupture), fantasy (Alice ou\n la dernierefugue) , war films (La Ligne de dimarcation, Une affaire de\nfemmes), spy films (the Tigre series and La Route de Corinthe) and\nglossy literary adaptations (Quiet Days in Clichy, Madame Bovary).\n But the crime thriller is his usual choice of genre, because it\nallows him to engage the spectator via the plot, and then explore\nthe complexities of character, morality, society and politics within\nan accessible and satisfying framework. Or as he puts it, \'c\'est le\ngenre qui emmerde le moins le public\'lo (Sorg 1998: 35). He has\noften been described as specialising in the psychological thriller,\nbut this is slightly misleading. Although he is greatly interested in\ncharacter and situation, Chabrol does not concern himself with\npsychology as an area of knowledge. Human motivations remain\nobscure rather than transparent. Actions (particularly crimes) and\n\n 9 \'One man and his job\', published by Robert laffont. Includes accounts by a\n   private detective, an agronomist, a king, and, despite the series title, by a\n   businesswoman and a (female) singer.\n10 \'it\'s the least boring genre for the audience\'\n\f                                                CHABROl AND FRIENDS            5\n\ntheir consequences are shown in uncompromising - and often\nblackly comic - detail, but no comforting explanations are given.\nAs Chabrol says, \'mon grand plaisir, c\'est de reveler l\'opacite\'"\n(Guerin and Jousse 1995: 30). This is particularly true of his\nfemale characters. How much do we learn about the enigmatic\nand ultimately disembodiedl2 female protagonists of films such as\nLe Boucher, Les Innocents aux mains sales, Violette Noziere, Betty and\nLa Ceremonie? Even the male characters - whose psychology is\noften less obscure - tend to maintain an ambivalence which thwarts\nsimple definitions of good and evil. From Le Beau Serge and Les\nCousins, via Que la bite meure and Le Boucher, to Masques and Le\nCri du hibou, they are simultaneously victims and perpetrators.\nMoral relativism is the recurrent theme of Chabrol\'s work: \'my\n"great testament," my "definitive message" is ... Don\'t judge!\'\n(Yakir 1979: 5)·\n    Although there is a personal (moral) imperative underlying\nChabrol\'s films, their means of production is collective. This is of\ncourse true of almost all films, but with Chabrol there is great\nemphasis on the contribution of the film crew. From his very first\nfilms, Chabrol built up a trusted team which has continued to work\nwith him more or less throughout his career. The heart of the crew\nhas been as follows: Jean Rabier (cinematography), Guy Chichignoud\n(sound), Pierre Jansen (music), Jacques Gaillard/Monique Fardoulis\n(editing). There have also been favourite actors at various periods\nofChabrol\'s career, including Jean-Claude Brialy, Michel Bouquet,\nJean Yanne, Stephane Audran and Isabelle Huppert. Audran and\nHuppert have been especially important, incarnating the enig-\nmatic and ultimately unknowable heroines of some of Chabrol\'s\nmost famous work. Audran was Chabrol\'s second wife, and has\nappeared in over twenty of his films, from Les Cousins in 1958 to\nBetty in 1992. Above all, she starred in the Helene cycle of 1968-\n71, in which she embodied the bourgeoisie of the period and\nfacilitated Chabrol\'s ambivalent attitude towards it: \'Elle en repre-\nsente une idealisation ... L\'idee etait que les films devenaient\n\nIl   \'my great pleasure is to reveal opacity\'\n12   Many of these films end with a dose-up of the protagonist\'s face. apparently\n     floating in space.\n\f6    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n doubles: it la fois une satire de la bourgeoisie et un aboutissement,\n une sorte de modele"J (Jousse and Toubiana 1997: 8). In 1978,\n Isabelle Huppert took the lead in Violette Noziere while Audran\n played her mother. The torch was in a sense being passed from\none to the other, with Huppert going on to work regularly with\n Chabrol over the next two decades.\n    Always a metaphorical family, Chabrol\'s film crew has recently\nbecome something of a literal family too. His third wife Aurore is\nstill the \'script-girl\' (as she has been since the 1970s) and his step-\ndaughter Ct~cile Maistre is now the first assistant. One of his sons,\n Matthieu, composes the score (replacing Pierre Jansen in 1982),\nwhile another, Thomas, has appeared in Une affaire de femmes,\n Madame Bovary, Betty and L\'Enfer. Chabrol has always been\nrenowned for his good humour on the set, and for the affection\ngenerated within his film crews, actors included: \'La creation se\nfait rnieux dans la joie. Pourquoi ne pas vivre en bons compagnons,\netre doux les uns avec les autres, de temps en temps faire la fete,\nen tout cas se marrer le plus souvent possible, bien bouffer?"4\n(Chabrol 1976: 186). It may well be that the relaxed atmosphere of\nhis shoots and his well-known love of good food and drink added\nto his long-standing reputation as a casual film-maker. It is\ncertainly true that he filmed Ten Days\' Wonder in Alsace solely in\norder to enjoy the local cuisine, and that he was drunk for most of\nthe shoot on La Ligne de demarcation. But his attitude remains\nunchanged. As he recently told Te1erama on the set of his fifty-first\nfilm, Au creur du mensonge, \'On ne sait jamais si un film sera\nreussi ni s\'il aura du succes .... Par contre, on peut toujours reussir\nle tournage, et en faire un succes\'l, (Sorg 1998: 35).\n    Although Chabrol wrote some of his most famous films alone\n(including La Femme infidele and Le Boucher), he collaborated with\n\n13 \'She represents an idealisation of it ... The idea was that the films became\n   double·edged: at the same time a satire on the bourgeoisie and its culmination,\n   a kind of model\'\n14 \'Creativity is aided by happiness. Why not be good friends, why not be nice to\n   each other, live it up now and then, in any case have a laugh as often as possible\n   and eat well?\'\n15 \'You never know if a film will work, nor ifitwill bea success. On the other hand,\n   you can always make the filming work. and make it a success\'\n\f                                               CHABROl AND FRIENDS             7\n\nhis friend Paul Gegauff on many screenplays over the first twenty\nyears of his career. Perhaps the most productive influence within\nChabrol\'s crew, Gegauff was also the most destructive personality.\nChabrol first met him in 1950 at Le Celtic film club in the Latin\nQuarter of Paris. Chabrol was in the audience as Gegauff, dressed\nas a Nazi officer, interrupted the screening of a British war film to\ncomplain that it was in bad taste. This anecdote encapsulates\nGegauffs dangerous appeal: a dandy and a joker, a Germano-\nphile, a scourge of good taste, of bourgeois manners and morals.\nHe was also, in the early 1950s, a successful novelist and some-\nthing of a playboy. He became an influence on several of the\nyoung new wave directors, including Eric Rohmer and Jean-Luc\nGodard. To Chabrol, he became a close friend and a fascinating\nmodel of cynicism and amorality. GegaufPs apparent racism and\nright-wing views, like his drinking and womanising, made a\ntantalising contrast with Chabrol\'s own left-wing humanism, and\nhis status as a Catholic family man. 16 The attraction and contrast\nbetween Chabrol and Gegauff was to be represented time and\nagain in two character types, Charles and Paul. (Usually they are\nmale rivals for Helene, a female character based to a degree on\nStephane Audran.) Charles is an ironic version of the young Chabrol:\ninnocent, reserved, repressed. Paul is Gegauff: cynical, charis-\nmatic, provocative. Established in 1958 with Les Cousins, Chabrol\'s\nsecond film and the first on which Gegauff collaborated, the\npairing was to reappear, with slight variations (and changes of\nname) in Les Godelureaux (Arthur and Ronald), Les Biches (Paul),\nLa Femme infidele (Charles and Victor), Que la bete meure (Charles\nand Paul), Le Boucher (Charles and Popaul), La Rupture (Charles\nand Paul),Juste avant la nuit (Charles), and Docteur Popaul (Popaul).\nThe series culminated in 1974 with Une partie de plaisir, after which\nGegauffs dandies tend to disappear from Chabrol\'s work. (The\nfinal film collaboration between the two was Les Magiciens a year\nlater, featuring a dandy called Edouard. It was a commercial\n\n16 Although Chabrol has always maintained that Gegauffs racism was simply a\n   ploy to wind up left-wingers like himself. Antoine de Baecque. in an excellent\n   essay. has accused Gegauff of genuine anti-Semitism. I have made use of this\n   essay (de Baecque 1997) for my account of Gegauffs life and death.\n\f8    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\ndisaster, and Chabrol reckons it is one of his very worst films.)\n    Une partie de plaisir dramatises - and hence exorcises - the\npower of GegaufPs personality. That power is described by Chabrol\nas follows: \'11 fascinait par son cote jusqu\'auboutiste dans l\'auto-\ndestruction, un gout du paradoxe extraordinaire et une elegance\nvraie. Mais il m\'a montre egalement jusqu\'ou cette direction\npouvait aller dans l\'autodestruction\'I7 (de Baecque 199T 90).\n Based on an autobiographical screenplay by Gegauff, Une partie de\nplaisir details the break-up of an apparently happy family. Raw and\ntraumatic in its realism (brought home by Chabrol\'s decision to\nhave Gegauff, his ex-wife, and their little daughter all play their\nfictional selves - in their own house!), the film is also telling in its\nsymbolism: a working-through ofChabrol\'s fears about Gegauffs\ndestructive potential. Although at times fascinating and impress-\nive - entertaining his guests, discoursing on art and philosophy,\narguing brilliantly with hippies lB - the fictional Gegauff is also\nrepulsive (he is equated at one point with a spider attacking its\nprey). Like an intimate version of the right-wing patriarchs from\ncertain Chabrol films, Gegauffs character is autocratic and mani-\npulative: he uses his daughter and patronises, humiliates and\nassaults his wife, finally appearing to kill her. It is in fact Chabrol\'s\nown ideal - the family - that is threatened by Gegauff (fictional\nand real). (Chabrol tends to make a distinction between the bour-\ngeois family - which he considers a valid target for Gegauff and\nhis alter egos - and the \'real\' non-bourgeois, family - which he\nidealises.) On screen, Gegauff ends up in prison. Off screen, he\nbegan to drink more and more heavily, and gradually ceased to\nwork with Chabrol. His last scenario for the latter was a television\nadaptation of Edgar Allan Poe in 1981. In late 1983, Gegauff rang\nChabrol to say that after spending Christmas in Norway, he hoped\nto collaborate on a film project once more. On Christmas Eve, his\nyoung Norwegian wife stabbed him to death.\n\n17 \'He fascinated me by pushing at the limits of self·destruction, by his taste for\n   extraordinary paradoxes and his real elegance. But he also showed me just how\n   far this could take him into self·destruction\'\n18 Compare the attacks on pseudo·intellectualism and Eastern religions that\n   Chabrol makes in Les Biches, Que la Mte meure and Le Boucher.\n\f                                                  CHABROL AND FRIENDS               9\n\n    Chabrol\'s frequenting of film clubs in his youth opened him\nup to a less controversial but equally crucial influence: the cinema\nofFritz Lang and Alfred Hitchcock. It was Lang\'s The Testament of\nDr Mabuse, made in 1933 and seen by Chabrol in Paris after the\nwar, that inspired him to become a film-maker. Lang has remain-\ned one of Chabrol\'s heroes, and in 1976 he dedicated Alice ou la\nderniere fugue to the dying German director. What Chabrollearned\nfrom Lang\'s cinema was the use of dispassionate, objective camera-\nwork to evoke the theme of fate, and the importance of express-\nionist mise en scene - in other words, the manipulation of decor\nand objects to convey atmosphere and meaning. As Chabrol\nexplains, in Lang\'s expressionism \'On devrait comprendre de quoi\nil s\'agit, meme s\'il y avait une chaise a. la place de l\'acteur\'I9\n(Chabrol 1976:120). In contrast with Lang, Hitchcock uses the\nsubjective camera (the point-of-view shot) to realise the more\nintimate themes of voyeurism, guilt and innocence, and to\ngenerate a complicity between the spectator and the narrative: \'Par\nprincipe, par definition, il n\'y a chez Lang aucune subjectivite,\nalors que chez Hitchcock, des les premiers films realises en\nAmerique, presque tous les plans sont faits du point de vue d\'un\npersonnage, tantot l\'un, tantot l\'autre, puis intervient l\'objectivite,\nc\'est-a.-dire la subjectivite du spectateur\'20 (ibid.: 133-4). Like Lang,\nhowever, Hitchcock has been a recurrent influence on Chabrol\'s\nthinking about cinema, from the book on Hitchcock that he co-\nwrote with Eric Rohmer in 1957 to the use of subjective camera\nand voyeurism in his own work. The influences of Lang and\nHitchcock are especially recognisable in certain films and in\ncertain periods ofChabrol\'s career. Hence the Langian style of Les\nBiches, Que la bete meure and the films of the 1970s, and also of Dr\nM in 1989 (in some ways a remake of Lang\'s Mabuse series).\nWhile the 1960s thrillers L\'CBU du malin and La Femme inftdele\n\n19 \'You should be able to understand what it\'s all about even if the actor was\n   replaced by a chair\'\n20 \'On principle, by definition, there is no subjectivity in lang, while in Hitchcock,\n   from his first American fIlms onwards, almost every shot is fIlmed from the\n   point of view of one character or another. Then objectivity - that\'s to say, the\n   spectator\'s subjectivity - intervenes\'\n\f10    CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nboth owe a clear debt to Hitchcock, Chabrol\'s main Hitchcockian\nperiod dates from 1986 and Masques, a mm littered with seventeen\nreferences to the \'Master of Suspense\',>· By 1995 and La Cere-\nmonie, Chabrol could declare:\' A un moment j\'etais tres langien ...\nJe crois qu\'avec l\'age on devient hitchcockien\'" (Guerin and Jousse\n1995: 30). However, Chabrol\'s understanding ofLang and Hitch-\ncock most frequently results in a productive tension between their\ntwo legacies - between expressionism and voyeurism, objective\ncamera and subjective camera, fate and personal responsibility.\n    Probably the most important lesson that Chabrollearned from\nthe example of Lang and Hitchcock was that a mm-maker\'s\npersonal vision need not be incompatible with the demands of\ngenre cinema. Lang and Hitchcock worked throughout their\ncareers in popular genres, predominantly the thriller, but also the\nwestern and the fantasy mm (Lang), the comedy and the\nmelodrama (Hitchcock). Ironically, and cruelly for ChabroI. while\nin the 1950S the critics on Cahiers du cinema (himself included)\nwere able to reassess Lang and Hitchock\'s artistic status by\nobserving that a great auteur could work within genre cinema, in\nthe 1960s this point seemed to be forgotten in the widespread\ncondemnation (led by Cahiers) ofChabrol\'s fall from artistic grace\ninto the spy mm and the popular thriller. This irony is also\nsymptomatic ofChabrol\'s general relationship with the new wave\n- a movement which he helped to create, and which was quick to\nreject him - as we shall see in the next chapter.\n\n\n\nReferences\nde Baecque, A.

A film fan from an early age, he ran a film club in the\nvillage of Sardent (to which he had been evacuated from Paris\nduring the Second World War). On his return to the capital, he\nfrequented student film clubs where he met the future new-wave\ndirectors Fran~ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer and\nJacques Rivette. Like them, he venerated Hollywood cinema,\nwrote film criticism for Cahiers du cinema in the 195os, and shot\nhis first films at the end of the decade. He collaborated with\nRohmer on a study of Hitchcock, and with Truffaut and Godard\non the latter\'s film A bout de sou.ffle (1959). But there are also\nseveral ways in which Chabrol contradicts the new-wave model.\nHis account of A bout de sou.ffle suggests that Godard took over the\nproject because Chabrol and Truffaut were at odds with each other\n(Chabrol 1976: 137). Unlike the others, Chabrol had some experi-\nence of the film industry from within, having worked as press\nofficer for the American studio Fox. Whereas his colleagues tended\nto work for other directors or to experiment with short films\nbefore trying their first feature, Chabrol\'s first venture in film-\nmaking was the feature-length (and commercially successful) Le\nBeau Serge. The film was financed by Chabrol himself, using his\nfirst wife\'s family inheritance. His company, AJYM, produced\nseveral early new-wave films, including Le Beau Serge and Les\nCousins (both 1958), but also Jacques Rivette\'s Le Coup du berger\n\f                                                          THE NEW WAVE           13\n\n\n(1956), Eric Rohmer\'s Le Signe du lion (1958) and Jacques\nGaillard\'s La Ligne droite (1961). Despite the financial support he\ngave his colleagues, Chabrol has stated that the supposed solid-\narity and coherence of the group was just a myth - as in the case of\nA bout de sou.fJle - and that the new wave was never an artistic\nmovement like, say, surrealism. In fact, the marketing of the new\nwave in the late 1950S struck him as cynical and manipulative:\n\'Entre 1958 et 1959, les copains des Cahiers et moi, passes a la\nrealisation, avons ete promus comme une marque de savonnette.\nNous etions la "nouvelle vague" .... si la grande presse a tant parle\nde nous, c\'est qu\'on voulait imposer l\'equation: de Gaulle egale\nRenouveau. Dans le cinema comme ailleurs. Le general arrive, la\nRepublique change, la France renait" (ibid.: 135). None the less,\nChabrol\'s first half a dozen films can be defined as his new wave\nperiod, featuring as they do several characteristics of nouvelle\nvague cinema: the filming of one\'s own scripts, a preference for\nshooting on location rather than in the studio, a degree of formal\nexperimentation, an interest in neorealism, and some reliance on\npopular genres such as the melodrama and the thriller.\n\n\n\nLe Beau Serge\nTo make his first film, Chabrol returned to the scene of his\nwartime childhood, the village of Sardent in central France. The\nreason for this was mainly financial: he had intended to shoot Les\nCousins first, but that story was set in Paris and would have been\ntwice as expensive to film. For the small budget of 32 million old\nfrancs, he was able to shoot Le Beau Serge (1958) over nine weeks\nin the winter of 1957/8, and to film it in what was essentially his\nhome village (several generations of Chabrol\'s family had come\n I   \'Between 1958 and 1959, me and my friends on Cahiers, once we\'d gone into\n     film directing. were promoted like a brand of soap. We were the "new wave". If\n     the daily papers talked about us so much. it was only because they wanted to\n     establish the idea that de Gaulle equals Renewal. In the cinema as elsewhere.\n     The General arrives, the Republic changes, France is reborn.\' (In 1958, General\n     Charles de Gaulle was elected president of France and inaugurated the Fifth\n     Republic.)\n\f14     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nfrom Sardent). The village is a crucial backdrop to the narrative\nand also provides extras and minor characters, such as the baker\n Michel Creuse. Le Beau Serge is most notable for its realistic setting\nand for the autobiographical elements within it. The latter include\na religious message (Chabrol was at this time a practising Catholic),\nthe death of a baby (which he and his wife had experienced), and\nabove all the central theme of a Parisian student returning to his\nprovincial roots. The clash of personalities between Frans:ois (Jean-\nClaude Brialy), the convalescent student returning from Paris,\nand his old friend Serge (Gerard Blain), a local boy who has stayed\nin the village, stuck in the rut of poverty and alcoholism, also\nheralds the power struggles between the Charles and Paul characters\nthat were to appear in Les Cousins and again in the HeUme cycle.\n    Originally, the finished film ran to two hours and thirty-five\nminutes, before Chabrol cut many of the scenes of village life,\nreducing it to the standard hour and a half. He later regretted\nlosing this quasi-documentary footage, but even so, many critics\nsaw - and praised - Le Beau Serge as a neorealist work. Established\nin postwar Italy, and extremely influential on the cinema of the\nnew wave, neorealism has been defined according to the following\nprinciples: \'Un message, actualite du scenario, sens du detail, sens\ndes foules, realisme, verite de l\'acteur, verite des decors, verite des\neclairages, photographie de style reportage, camera tn!s libre"\n(Martin 1975: 34)· Neorealist films tend to be characterised by\n\'location shooting, lengthy takes, unobtrusive editing, natural\nlighting, a predominance of medium and long shots, respect for\nthe continuity of time and space, use of contemporary, true-to-life\nsubjects, an uncontrived, open-ended plot, working-class prota-\ngonists, a nonprofessional cast, dialogue in the vernacular, active\nviewer involvement, and implied social criticism\' (Marcus 1986:\n22). Although Chabrol\'s later work was to deviate far from this\nmodel (particularly via the use of sophisticated editing, formal\nconstruction, stylised colour and expressionist mise en scene), Le\nBeau Serge sticks to it pretty closely. Where it differs most clearly is\n\n 2   \'A message. a contemporary screenplay. a grasp of detail, a grasp of the masses,\n     realism. truth in the acting, the decor and the lighting, reportage·style photo·\n     graphy. and very free camerawork\'\n\f                                                       THE NEW WAVE          15\n\n\nin its middle-class protagonist, Franltois, and in its (his) contrived\nplot to bring about Serge\'s salvation. Any social criticism implied\nby the film is in this way submitted to a religious message, and the\nresult is moralistic rather than political. However, as we shall see\nshortly, the ending of Chabrol\'s film is perhaps more open-ended\nand ambivalent than first appears.\n    Despite the vivacity of the camerawork and the occasional\nlyricism of the setting, Le Beau Serge is rather a schematic film.\nThis is because ofChabrol\'s religious convictions, which permeate\nnot just the characterisation, but also the composition of indivi-\ndual shots and the themes of Emile Delpierre\'s score. In his\npositive review of the film for Arts magazine, Truffaut called it\n\'une partie de dames jouee par deux jeunes hommes, Gerard\nBlain le pion noir, et Jean-Claude Brialy le pion blanc. Au moment\nprecis ou les deux se rencontrent, ils changent de couleur et\ngagnent ex-aequo\') (Truffaut 1958: 54). Truffaut\'s perceptive first\ncomment is certainly borne out by the characterisation of \'bad\'\nSerge (associated with black) and \'good\' Franltois (associated with\nwhite). But his conclusion seems a little generous and is not\nshared by Chabrol. He speaks instead of a heavy-handed symbol-\nism (Braucourt 1971: IIZ), which is evident from the very start of\nthe film, and which reaches its pitch at the end. In the opening\nscene, Franltois arrives by bus in the village square. As the camera\n(mounted on top of the bus) pans to one side to reveal Serge and\nhis father-in-law Glomaud, both drunk, a sudden burst of music\nemphasises the threat posed by these characters to the innocent\nnewcomer. Throughout the film, distinct musical themes are\nused to characterise Franltois (bright, lyrical strings and flutes)\nand Serge (ominous, rumbling brass and drums). When Franltois\nruns round the village like a child, it is to the sound of flutes;4\nwhen Serge, like a drunken ogre, chases the schoolchildren from\nthe square, it is to the sound of drums. On their second meeting,\n\n3 \'a game of draughts played out by two young men, Gerard Blain as black and\n  Jean·Claude Brialy as white. At the precise moment when they meet, they change\n  colour and both win\'\n4 The flutes are also associated with the schoolchildren, whose innocence and\n  goodness Fran~ois apparently shares.\n\f16    CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nwhen the two friends embrace, their musical motifs are mingled\nbefore the lyrical, optimistic theme wins out (a microcosm of the\nnarrative itself). The categorisation of \'good\' Fram;:ois and \'bad\'\nSerge is mirrored by that of the female characters, the long-suffer-\ning Yvonne (Serge\'s wife) and her promiscuous younger sister\nMarie. As Truffaut suggests, colour is used symbolically in the\nfilm, for the women as well as the men. This results in a mise en\nscene which, although not always formulaic, does at times seem\nheavily allegorical. For instance, when Fran~ois visits Serge\'s\nhouse for breakfast, the \'bad\' pair (Serge and Yvonne) are grouped\non the left of the frame and the \'good\' pair (Fran~ois and Marie) on\nthe right. Both sisters are standing, both men sitting at the table.\nDressed in white, Marie holds a bottle of milk (signifying her\nmaternal role and also Fran~ois\'s childlike innocence), while\nYvonne, dressed in a dark dress, hands a dark bottle of wine to the\nalcoholic Serge. While Marie pours milk into Fran~ois\'s coffee\nbowl, Serge pours wine into his. 5\n    The tension between good and evil, the clashing of opposite\npersonalities, and the over-dramatic score all lend Le Beau Serge an\nair of melodrama which it shares with several ofChabrol\'s films,6\nand which is also present in some Italian neorealism. But a degree\nof ambivalence also becomes apparent as the struggle between\nFran~ois and Serge develops. Serge may be equated with the\nstagnant village pond (which, he says, should be cleaned out, emp-\ntied, and started again), but Fran~ois\'s mission to cleanse his old\nfriend is not always presented as an unequivocally good thing.\nMarie tells him \'Tu as l\'air de nous regarder comme si on etait des\ninsectes - tu n\'aimes personne\'.7 The emphasis placed on Fran-\n~ois\'s voyeurism (we often see him looking at other characters,\nsometimes from the elevated safety of his hotel-room window)\nassociates him with many ofChabrol\'s later anti-heroes, including\nAlbin in L\'(EU du malin and Forestier in Le Cri du hibou. (It also\npositions him as a kind of alter ego for Chabrol, an outsider in his\n\n 5 One should note, however, that the colour symbolism is not absolutely\n   categorical: Serge is wearing white in this scene, and Fran~ois black.\n 6 Including Le Boucher (1969) and, in particular, La Rupture (1971). See Chapter 3.\n 7 \'You seem to look at us as if we\'re insects. You don\'t like anyone\'\n\f                                                           THE NEW WAVE           17\n\n\nown village, an intellectual returning to Sardent to let his camera\nrecord village life with a documentarist\'s curiosity.) Like Albin and\n Forestier, Franc;:ois is in many ways an interloper, an intruder who\ndisturbs the natural order, spreading discord wherever he goes.\nThis is most evident when he tells Glomaud what the whole village\nknows but has never admitted: that Marie is not his daughter.\nWhen Glomaud proceeds to rape her, Franc;:ois, rather than blame\nhimself, dismisses the villagers as \'animals\' beyond redemption.\nHis plan to save Serge, meanwhile, involves breaking up his\nmarriage with Yvonne (despite the fact that she is pregnant), and\nsoon alienates all those around him. He is told by Yvonne that\nSerge has become even more unhappy since his arrival. (The\noriginal reason for Serge\'s despairing alcoholism is the death of\nhis handicapped baby son.) Eventually all the villagers, including\nthe maternal landlady, tell him to leave. And yet the film ends with\nan apparently triumphant portrayal of Franc;:ois\'s efforts to save\nthe village, to give them a Christ-like example, and to redeem the\nprincipal sinner, Serge, by dragging him through the snow to\nwitness the birth of his (healthy) child.\n    It is this moralising conclusion, complete with symbols of\ncrosses and the martyrdom of Franc;:ois, which Chabrol now dis-\nowns, and which sets Le Beau Serge apart from the rest of his work,\nwhere there are few value judgements and where the endings are\nresolutely ambivalent. The key is provided by Chabrol\'s Catholic\nfaith at the time he made the film, and by his subsequent loss of\nfaith. As he explains, Le Beau Serge \'m\'a completement dechris-\ntianise. J\'avais surcharge ce film de tout un symbolique imbecile.\nIl fallait le faire pour que j\'en sois debarasse. Maintenant, c\'est\nfini\'8 (Braucourt 1971: II2-13). Chabrol remains vague as to\nexactly when his crisis of faith took place: \'J\' etais chretien dans le\ntemps, j\'ai cesse de I\'Hre entre 1957 et 1959\'9 (ibid.). This begs the\nquestion, when exactly did Chabrol lose his religion? Was it\nactually during the making of Le Beau Serge (winter 1957/8)? And\nif not, was the crisis not at least signalled (unconsciously) in the\n\n 8 \'it completely de-christianised me.

I stopped being one between 1957 and 1959\'\n\f18    ClAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nfinal section of the film? One thinks of Chabrol\'s assessment of\n Balzac as a novelist whose work has a meaning completely opposed\nto his conscious intentions: \'11 a dit qu\'il ecrivait a la lumiere de\ndeux fIambeaux, l\'Eglise et la Royaute. De conviction, il est vrai\nqu\'il etait monarchiste et catholique. En meme temps, ce qu\'il\necrit dame le contraire\'(O (Chabrol 1976: 346). The same could be\nsaid of Chabrol and Le Beau Serge - the film in fact deconstructs\nand lays bare (as a comforting illusion) the moralising Catholi-\ncism it ostensibly celebrates.\n    If this is so, the canonical reading of the film (which Chabrol\nshares) is undermined by a second interpretation. The first might\nbe said to be the conscious reading, the second the \'dream\nreading\'." According to the dream reading, the final twenty minu-\ntes or so of Le Beau Serge would be Fran~ois\'s subjective fantasy."\nThe main due to this possibility is the dreamlike mise en scene of\nthe condusion, and in particular the fairytale atmosphere evoked\nby the falling snow. After he is beaten up by Serge at the village\ndance, and rejected by the entire village, Fran~ois is confronted\nwith the image of a cross (in fact the frame of a window), the first\nof many in the dosing scenes. He returns to his hotel room, where\nthe landlady appears and advises him to leave Sardent once and\nfor all. In response he leans his battered face against the door of\nhis room and mumbles \'Non\'. The beautiful image that follows\nsuggests that we are passing from bleak neorealism into comfort-\ning fantasy: while Fran~ois\'s face remains in dose-up (providing\nthe anchor for the subjective scenes to come), Chabrol super-\nimposes onto it a shot of swirling snowflakes. The effect is as if\nFran~ois has entered a dreamland, a childhood of the mind where\nhe becomes the Christian saviour he has longed to be, and where,\nlike an affronted child, he finally gets to \'show\' everyone who\ndoubted or rejected him. In the next shot, the village is covered in\n10 \'He said that he wrote by the light of two flames, the Church and the monarchy.\n   It is true that, by conviction, he was a monarchist and a Catholic. But at the same\n   time, what he wrote proclaims the opposite\'\n11 The term \'dream reading\' is taken from Chris Marker\'s superb reinterpretation\n   of Hitchcock\'s Vertigo, according to which \'the entire second part would be\n   nothing but a fantasy\' (Marker 1995= 126).\n12 Two critics have suggested as much (Magny 1987: 83\'5, Blanche! 1989: 17).\n\f                                                          THE NEW WAVE           19\n\n\nsnow and young children are going to school. Gentle music is\nheard as we are given Fran~ois\'s view of the village from his\nwindow. Whether he has really woken or is dreaming, whether he\nin fact leaves his bed or remains in it, fantasising as he lies dying,\nall that follows conforms to his wish for martyrdom. Telling the\npriest that the villagers need his help, Fran~ois goes out for the\nfirst time in a fortnight. He is reconciled with Yvonne. Then, in\nthe night, he is told that she is in labour. Disregarding his own\nweak health, he runs through the snow, first to find the doctor and\nthen to look for Serge. like Father Logan in Hitchcock\'s I Confess\n(1953), he embarks on a physical journey which parallels the\nstations of the cross.Ij At each stage of his journey, Fran~ois is met\nby crosses: the window frame at Glomaud\'s house (where he finds\nthe doctor), the fence by the hen-coop (where he eventually finds\nSerge, in an alcoholic stupor) the door and window frames of\nYvonne\'s house (where he drags Serge in time for the birth). As he\nsearches for Serge in the snow, the light from his torch throws a\nhalo around him. And when he finally collapses, having engin-\neered Serge\'s redemption, his final words are Tai cru\'.14 Every-\nthing seems to have been resolved through his powers of faith - or,\nif one chooses the dream reading, through his powers of fantasy.\'l\n\n\n\nLes Cousins\nAt the last minute, Le Beau Serge was pulled as the official French\nentry for the 1958 Cannes film festival. Even so, Chabrol showed\nthe film outside the competition, where it was well received, and\nhe managed to sell it to one or two foreign distributors. He was\nnow in a position to shoot Les Cousins (1958) in Paris as he had\nwanted (at a cost of 62 million old francs). The film tells how\n13 See Rohmer\'s interpretation of I Confess in the book he co-wrote with Chabrol\n   (Rohmer and Chabrol 1957: II7)- Hitchcock\'s film is a probable influence on Le\n    Beau Serge.\n14 \') believed\'\n15 The ominous music, Serge\'s mad laughter, and the blurred close-up on his\n   hysterical face (which suggests a skull) do go some way to qualifying this \'feel-\n   good\' ending_\n\f20    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nCharles, a provincial law student (Gerard Blain), stays With his\nParisian cousin Paul (Jean-Claude Brialy). Cynical and charisma·\ntic, Paul parties hard, cheats at his law exams, and seduces Florence,\nwith whom his cousin had fallen in love. Under the strain, the\n\'good\' Charles (who works hard but fails) is tempted to murder his\ncousin, but cannot even manage that. The next morning, Paul kills\nCharles accidentally with the loaded gun intended for him. Where\n Le Beau Serge attracted seventy thousand spectators in Paris, Les\n Cousins was seen by over two hundred and fifty thousand (Brau-\ncourt 1971: 177). The new wave was taking off, and Chabrol was in\nthe vanguard. The reception of Les Cousins was, however, in one\nway problematic - and was a sign of things to come for Chabrol.\n    Les Cousins deviates from neorealism in ways that Le Beau Serge\ndoes not. For instance, contrary to neorealism\'s long takes and\nunobtrusive editing, Les Cousins features a bravura sequence of\nfast editing, a new-wave celebration of Parisian landmarks seen\nfrom a speeding car (comparable to a similar sequence in Godard\'s\nA bout de soulJle). None the less, Chabrol\'s second film does also\nhave a realistic setting: the Latin Quarter, and in particular the so-\ncalled \'capo de droit\' run by Parisian law students. But while\ncritics had been quick to praise Chabrol\'s portrayal of Sardent as\ncompletely naturalistic, there was a certain reluctance to acknow-\nledge the accuracy of his view of student Paris. Les Cousins was in\nfact based on Chabrol\'s own experiences at the \'capo de droit\'\nbetween 1947 and 1949. One of the very few left-wingers to be\nwelcomed by the group (apparently because of his sense of\nhumour), Chabrol witnessed their flirtations with Fascist ideology,\nand the charismatic presence of their leader, a certain Jean-Marie\nLe Pen.\'6 The rationale for the film was therefore, among other\nthings, to show the dangerous appeal of Fascism. (One could also\nsay that it dramatises the dangerous appeal of Chabrol\'s friend\nand the film\'s co-writer, Paul Gegauff.) As Chabrol discovered,\nalthough Les Cousins was a great commercial success, it was the\nfirst of his films to be totally misunderstood by some critics: \'Les\ngens, a l\'epoque, ne croyaient pas qu\'il y avait des fascistes en\nFrance. C\'est aussi bete que cela. Ils ont donc cru que c\'etait moi le\n16 Later to become leader ofthe French National Front.\n\f                                                          THE NEW WAVE           21\n\n\nfasciste, puisqu\'ils ne voulaient pas croire que c\'etait ceux qu\'ils\nvoyaient sur l\'ecran\'I7 (Collet and Tavernier 1962.: 7). Although\nChabrol\'s point was proved by events of the early 1960s (such as\nthe putsch of 1961 and the activities of the OAS - Organisation de\nl\'arrnee secrete - terrorists), the \'Fascist\' tag unfortunately stuck\nlong enough to dominate the critical reception of Les Bonnes\nFemmes in 1960 (see p. 2.8).\n    The narrative of us Cousins reworks the fable of the town\nmouse and the country mouse. But it is also derived from the\nnovels of Balzac, especially the rites of pas3age faced by Rastignac\nin Le Pere Gorlot. like Charles, Rastignac is a provincial law student,\ndevoted to his mother, eager to make his way in Paris, and in\nmany ways repulsed by the cynical society he finds there. But\nwhere Charles turns inwards and destroys himself, Rastignac\nadapts to the unpleasant realities of his new environment. A\nsimilar story is told in Les Illusions perdues, the Balzac novel which\nCharles is given by the bookseller and which he refuses to read (he\nhas lost his own illusions by himself at the end of the film). The\nparallel with Balzac is not just limited to the narrative, however.\nLes Cousins, co-written by Gegauff, sees the introduction of the\nCharles and Paul characters (and, in Florence, a prototype HeIene)\nwhich were to recur in the Helene cycle of the late 1960s and early\n1970s. Balzac himself had, in the early 1830s, toyed with the idea\nof using the same initials or first names for characters in different\nworks. From 1832. onwards, he went further, and certain charac-\nters appeared and reappeared in various novels. The intention\nbehind this - to create a huge, coherent whole out of numerous\nsmaller works - is echoed by Chabrol\'s films from Les Cousins on-\nwards (and, in microcosm, by the Helene cycle). In his auto-\nbiography Chabrol describes Balzac\'s Comedie humaine as a giant\nmosaic, where the whole is more important than any constituent\npart, before adding: \'En toute modestie, c\'est ma demarche ... Il\nn\'est pas indispensable que chacun de mes films soit considere\ncomme parfait. 11 se peut que j\'aie seulement voulu illustrer une\n\n17 \'At the time, people didn\'t believe that there were Fascists in France. It was as\n   stupid as that. So they thought that I was a Fascist, because they didn\'t want to\n   think that the characters on the screen were\'\n\f22     ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n idee qui etait apparue dans un film et que je reprendrai. Ce que je\n cherche c\'est que l\'ensemble de mes realisations donne une idee\n tres precise d\'une vision des choses\'18 (Chabrol 1976 : 347).\n    Where Les Cousins suggest the Chabrolian vision much more\n clearly than Le Beau Serge is in the ambivalence of the character-\n isation and in the detailed exploration of power relations (usually\nexpressed spatially). The \'good\' and \'bad\' roles from the first film\nare resurrected in the second only to be more strongly challenged.\n In this case, Charles is not only innocent, diligent and well-mean-\ning, he is also naive, over-idealistic and puritanical. On several\noccasions he actually rejects Florence so that he can keep studying\nfor his exams. Paul, meanwhile, although manipulative, egocen-\ntric and cynical, is also a fun-loving pragmatist (in this he actually\nressembles Chabrol as well as Gegauff). As Florence\'s choice\nsuggests, Paul is sexually more magnetic than the inhibited and\nrather adolescent Charles. And, in the final analysis, while Charles\ntries to murder Paul, the latter is quite possibly in love with the\nformer, and is certainly grief-stricken by his death (see below, p.\n24). The interrelations between the two cousins (and Florence) are\nexpressed spatially, but without any of the religious or moral\nsymbolism that weighed down Le Beau Serge. In Us Cousins,\nspatial compositions express power rather than morality.\'9 Unsur-\nprisingly, the power tends to belong to Paul. This is best revealed\nin two sequences showing Charles entering Paul\'s apartment in\nNeuilly. On his first arrival, he finds his cousin on top of a ladder\nlooking through a telescope. Naturally enough, Paul looks down at\nCharles, who has to look up to him. The construction is realistic,\nbut also symbolic - a lesson learned from Lang\'s expressionism.\nThe second example is even more explicit, since Chabrol shows\ntwo levels of the apartment in a single shot, to emphasise the\n\n18 \'In all modesty, that\'s also my approach. It\'s not vital for each of my films to be\n   considered perfect. I might only have wanted to illustrate an idea that had\n   appeared in a previous film, and that I\'ll take up again later. What I\'m after is\n   that my films as a whole give a very precise idea of a personal vision.\' (This is\n   probably Chabrol\'s most auteurist statement to date.)\n19 The power relations in Juste avant la nuit (1971), Les Innocents aux mains sales\n   (1975) and La Ceremonie (1995) are similarly expressed by open· plan decors and\n   spatial compositions. See Chapters 3, 4 \' and 7 respectively.\n\f                                                       THE NEW WAVE           23\n\n\ncharacters\' respective positions. Having failed to meet Florence at\nthe university, Charles returns to Neuilly, where he finds her\ntogether with Paul. The new couple are on the first floor, while\nCharles is framed on the ground floor, beneath them. A similarly\nexpressive composition a little later - once Florence has moved\nin with Paul - shows her sunbathing topless in the bay of a\nwindow, with Charles standing, again, beneath her. Her idealised,\nunattainable status in his eyes is expressed not just by the spatial\nrelation between them, but by the railings which literally bar his\nview of her body. In the closing stages of the film, Charles\'s\ninability to mentally shut out Paul and Florence is reflected\nvisually by their ubiquitous presence behind the frosted glass\ndoors of his study (either partying in the living-room or showering\ntogether in the bathroom). In short, the apartment becomes an\nexpression of Charles\'s state of mind. And while Paul and\nFlorence (and their numerous friends) use the open living-room,\nCharles himself remains closed off, isolated, unable actually to\nlive (hence unable to enter the living-space).\n     Similarly, the mise en scene expresses Paul\'s embryonic Fascism.\nThe decor of the apartment - the ranks of toy soldiers seen in the\nfirst shot, the trophies and guns on the wall - suggests a fascin-\nation with military power and with stylised violence. Emphasis is\nplaced on the pistol which Paul, Charles and the Italian count all\nplay with, and which is ultimately loaded by Charles with fatal\nconsequences. (There is a similar emphasis on the decor of\nFrederique\'s villa, with the dagger on the wall, in Les Biches (1967),\nLes Cousins\'s sister film). Since German culture is actually used\nin Les Cousins as a shorthand for Paul\'s leanings towards Fascism,\nit is no surprise to see candlelight and huge shadows - associated\nwith German expressionism - in the sequence where Paul, wear-\ning a Nazi officer\'s cap, wanders through the party reading Goethe\nin German to the strains of Wagner\'s Gotterdammerung.\'o The\nprecise piece of music used here is worth noting. Paul puts on the\n\n20 Compare Chabrol\'s first meeting with Gegauff (see Chapter I, p. 72). It should\n   perhaps be noted that it was Chabrol and not Gegauffwho devised the scene\n   where the Jewish student is awoken by Paul shouting that the Gestapo are\n   coming (see Collet and Tavemier 1962: 7).\n\f24     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n\'Death of Siegfried\', an apparently apt choice for the recital of a\npoem about the death of a soldier. But the music has other\nconnotations within the narrative, as the end of the scene reveals.\nAs the music reaches its poignant close, Paul repeats the last line\nof the poem - \'love is born\' - while staring despondently at\nCharles and Florence, who have just begun to kiss. There is a\nsuggestion here (via the music and the poem) that Paul is mourn·\ning the birth of Charles\'s love for Florence, and hence the death of\na possible love between the two cousins. This implicit theme -\nPaul\'s love for Charles - is reiterated by the film\'s brilliant ending,\nwhich first sees the complete destruction of Charles\'s identity (his\nfailure at the exams, his virtual suicide when he throws his\nstudent card and notes into the Seine, his half-hearted attempt to\nkill Paul by a kind of Russian roulette) and then his accidental\nshooting by Paul. Again, Wagner\'s music evokes the death oflove,\nthis time literally (the piece is the Liebestod from Tristan und\nIsolde).2I As the music reaches its crescendo, Charles falls dead at\nPaul\'s feet. The closing cadences drift away as Paul sits, stunned,\nby his cousin\'s body and realises what has happened. The\nLiebestod expresses his own mourning for Charles\'s death as\nmuch as Isolde\'s for Tristan\'s. Someone rings at the door, and\nwhile the music fades to silence and Paul goes to confront the\nfuture, a slow camera movement reveals the record-player. The\nstylus lifts up, the record stops, the film ends. Game over.\n\n\n\nLes Bonnes Femmes\nDuring the making of Les Cousins, Chabrol met Stephane Audran\n(she plays the part of Fran~oise, one of Paul\'s friends). His\nrelationship with his first wife, Agnes, was in disarray. Theyeven-\ntually divorced, and Chabrol married Audran in 1964. AJYM\nFilms, the production company Chabrol had set up with Agnes\'s\ninheritance, was wound up in the early 1960s. The commercial\npressures associated with making films for producers other than\n21   Liebestod means \'love\'s death\'. In the opera, Tristan dies from a wound only\n     Isolde can heal. On hearing of his death, she dies of a broken heart.\n\f                                                        THE NEW WAVE           25\n\n\nhimself were about to become a determining factor in the\ndevelopment of Chabrol\'s career. At first, there were no problems.\nThe Hakim brothers financed his third film, allowing him not\nonly to shoot the flashbacks he wanted, but also to film in colour -\nthe other producers he approached had granted him one or the\nother but not both! The first of Chabrol\'s many adaptations of crime\nnovels, A double tour (1959) was carefully constructed so that\n\'c\'etait le recit lui-meme qui faisait un double tour. En outre,\nj\'avais tourne avec beaucoup de mouvements circulaires. Le film\ndevait representer un cercle qui se dedouble sur lui-meme\'"\n(Chabrol 1976: 152). A double flashback was used, so that \'Le\npremier raconte ce qui s\'est passe un peu plus tot, le second\nraconte ce qui s\'est passe pendant le premier\'2l (Collet and\nTavernier 1962: 8). This attention to structure was only partly\nsuccessful - \'C\'etait tres construit, mais les gens ont cru que c;:a\nallait dans tous les sens\'24 (ibid.) - and was to be even more invol-\nved and even less understood in Chabrol\'s controversial fourth\nfilm, Les Bonnes Femmes (1960).\n    Despite the relative failure of A double tour at the box office (it\ncost twice as much as Les Cousins, but attracted only half the\nnumber of spectators), the Hakim brothers were prepared to\nfinance Chabrol\'s next film - probably, he explains, because they\nthought from the title that Les Bonnes Femmes would be some kind\nof sex comedy (Chabrol 1976: 152). To the disappointment of\nalmost everybody, it was nothing of the sort. Instead, the film\npainted a bleak picture of the boredom and alienation of four shop\nassistants, each of whom struggles to break out of her environ-\nment but fails, and one of whom is ultimately murdered. With a\nsubtlety he had not shown before, Chabrol mixed together two\ndistinct elements in an unsettling synthesis: neorealism and\nthriller, tedium and suspense, banality and menace. These strands\nare reflected by Pierre Jansen\'s score: by turns wistful and lyrical,\n22 \'it was the story itself which went round twice. What\'s more, I included lots of\n   circular camera movements. The film was meant to represent a circle which\n   doubled back on itself\n23 \'The first one shows what happened a little earlier, and the second one shows\n   what happened during the first one\'\n24 \'It was very structured, but people thought it was all over the place\'\n\f26     ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nin neorealist style (evoking the girls\' frustrated dreams), and\nsuspenseful and dark, as in a thriller (for the appearances of the\nmysterious motorcyclist). Chabrol and Gegauff also gave the film\nan intricate structure, made up of different episodes to reflect the\ncomings and goings of the characters. The result was, according to\nChabrol, a heptahedron (ibid.: 195). In other words, the film corn·\nprises seven sections;5 identifiable as follows:\n1    Jane (Bernadette Laffont) goes to a nightclub with Albert and\n     Marcel and then back to their flat for sex;·6\n2    Rita (Lucile Saint-Simon) goes with the others to a restaurant,\n     where she meets her fiance Henri;\n3    the four girls go to the zoo together;\n4    Ginette (Stephane Audran) is discovered by the others singing\n     at a music-hall;\n5    they all go to the swimming-pool, where Albert and Marcel\n     reappear;\n6    Jacqueline (Clotilde Joano) finally goes on a date with Andre,\n     the motorcyclist, and is murdered by him in the woods;\n7    in a cryptic coda, a fifth, unnamed bonne femme is introduced,\n     dancing at a nightclub with a man whose face we do not see.\nEach of the four young women (and by implication, the fifth) thus\nseeks a different route out of their situation: sex and a good time,\nmarriage into the bourgeoisie, a theatrical career, romance. The\nonly one who escapes is Jacqueline, and she does so not through\nromance but through death.\n   The neorealist depiction of Paris in the film - the scenes in the\nmetro, the swimming-pool, the music-hall, and above all the\nnightclub, where the camera-work is so free and shaky as to\nsuggest hastily snatched documentary footage - is complemented\nby the pacing of the narrative. There are long sequences where\nscreen time and real time are one, and where nothing happens,\nslowly. The evocation of durie (the duration of time) is a trait of\n\n25 Discounting the two \'empty\' periods of time when all four girls are shown\n   working in the shop.\n26 Jacqueline is also present for the first half of the episode. The sex is implied but\n   not actually shown.\n\f                                                        THE NEW WAVE          27\n\n\nneorealist cinema - \'substituant aux temps "dramatiques" du\ncinema traditionnel des temps faibles ou des temps morts"7\n(Martin 1975: 35) - but it can also imply suspense in a thriller\ncontext. The thriller element is provided here by the repeated\nappearances of Andre spying on the girls, by the equation between\nhim and the dangerous tiger made during the zoo sequence, and\nby Madame Louise\'s revelation to Jacqueline of her \'fetish\' (not\nthe romantic lucky charm one expects, but a handkerchief soaked\nin the blood of the guillotined serial killer Weidmann).\'s Con-\nsequently, in Les Bonnes Femmes time is both undramatic and\ndramatic, monotonous but (increasingly) suspenseful. The banal-\nity, the repetition, the waiting (especially in the shop sequences,\nwhere the girls wait for it to be time to go home) all beg the\nquestion, when is something filmic going to happen? By feeling\nthis, the spectator is implicated in Jacqueline\'s murder, either as\nperpetrator (by wanting something to happen to one of the girls)\nor in the Hitchockian sense, as victim (identifying with her,\nfeeling suspense and fear that something will happen to her).\nWhen Jacqueline\'s murder finally takes place, it is like a parody of\nromance. The long·awaited date with Andre is heavy with roman-\ntic expectation (both on the part of Jacqueline and, in all proba-\nbility, the spectator). A drive in the countryside, lunch in a\nrestaurant, and then a quiet walk in the woods ... But Andre is not\nthe romantic hero he appears to be in the swimming-pool scene\n(where he rescues Jacqueline from Albert and Marcel). He is\ncloser to the macabre Madame Louise. There are hints at his real\nmotive when he praises Jacqueline\'s long and slender neck, but\nthe possibilities - romance or death - are balanced against each\nother until the murder has been committed. Thus there are\nrepeated facial close-ups (associated with the filmic representation\nof sex), and we see the two lying down together in the bushes. It is\nonly when Andre climbs offJacqueline\'s inert body that it becomes\n27 \'which replaces the "dramatic" time of traditional cinema with uneventful or\n   empty time\'\n28 Weidmann was a sadistic killer of women (hence the suggestion that I acqueline\n   will end up being murdered). He was executed at Versailles in 1939 and some\n   women in the crowd dipped their handkerchiefs in his blood (see Collet and\n   Tavernier 1962: 12).\n\f28     ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nclear that we have been watching a strangulation rather than a sex\nscene.\n    Both the formal brilliance and the stark realism of Us Bonnes\n Femmes tended to leave spectators and critics cold. What attracted\nattention instead was Chabrol and GegaufPs supposedly cynical\ntreatment of their inadequate central characters. Infuriatingly for\nChabrol, the tenderness he felt for the four shop assistants and\ntheir attempts to break out of a restricted environment was\ncompletely ignored. The humour in the film was considered to be\ncruelty at their expense, although it is mostly directed at the men:\nAlbert and Marcel the louche pick-up artists; Rita\'s ludicrous\nfiance Henri, who coaches her furiously on culture while she\nwaits to meet his parents; and the shop owner Monsieur Belin,\nwho marks Jacqueline\'s first day at work by giving her a flower\nand serenading her, before explaining that all breakages will be\ndeducted from her wages. There were accusations, particularly\nfrom left-wing commentators, that Les Bonnes Femmes was full of\ncontempt for its working-class characters, that it was neorealism\nemptied of compassion, and even that it was a Fascist film. When\nasked in 1962 why the film had been considered Fascistic, Chabrol\nreplied: \'d\'une part, c;a vient sans doute des Cousins, d\'autre part,\ncomme les gens sont eux-memes meprisants, ils croient que moi,\naussi, je meprise"9 (Collet and Tavernier 1962: 12). In fact, as\nChabrol explained, Les Bonnes Femmes was an attempt to portray\nthe alienating social conditions of the uneducated working class,\nand as such could claim to be \'un film profondement marxiste\'}O\n(ibid.: 10). This is never more clear than in the zoo sequence,\nwhere the girls are shot through barred grilles as they look at the\nanimals: they too, are living their lives out in a cage.\n    Les Bonnes Femmes is perhaps above all a film which explores\nspectatorship. For all its (neo)realism, it is aware of itself as a\nspectacle, and frequently challenges the audience\'s expectations\nand desires. This gives it a certain new-wave self-consciousness\n\n29 \'on the one hand. that\'s because of [the \'fascist\' interpretation of] Les Cousins.\n   And also because. since people are themselves contemptuous [of the\n   characters], they think they think that [ also feel contempt for them\'\n30 \'A deeply Marxist film\'\n\f                                                THE NEW WAVE        29\n\n\nwhich is not present in Chabrol\'s later work. The three central\nexamples are the stage appearances of Dolly Bell and Ginette, and\nthe closing scene of the film (the coda). Each scene could be said to\naddress a different aspect of spectatorship: desire, identification\nand judgement. In the nightclub sequence, Chabrol considers the\ndesire of the audience (both in the club and in the cinema itself) to\nsee the stripper Dolly Bell. This is heightened by the mise en scene\n(the music announcing her imminent appearance, the curtains\nveiling the stage), but is denied - at least for the film audience - by\nthe camera-work, so that when she finally appears, Chabrol cuts to\na reverse-shot, revealing not the stripper but the nightclub audi-\nence, seen from her point of view. The filming of Ginette\'s\nperformance at the music-hall (wearing a black wig, and trans-\nformed into the supposedly Italian singer \'Angela Torrini\') refers\nback to the Dolly Bell sequence. But now (because of the narrative,\nwhich has introduced us to Ginette\'s singing ambitions, and\nwhich implies that she will be mortified if her friends find out),\nwhen we see the music-hall audience from the performer\'s point\nof view, we identifY with Ginette and share her perspective (and\nher fears of discovery). Finally, after Jacqueline\'s murder - in\nwhich the spectator is, as we have seen, at least partly implicated-\nChabrol closes the film with his enigmatic coda. The final shot is\nof the unknown young woman staring directly at the camera over\nthe shoulder of her dancing partner. This look (and the apparent\nlack of connection between the coda and the rest of the film) asks\nus to conclude on what we have seen. What is our judgement on\nthe lives of the bonnes femmes? Can we identifY with them? The\nlack of point-of-view shot here implies that we might not. Can we\nat least empathise? Faced with the banal and sad realism of the\nfilm (and by the gaze of the fifth bonne ftmme) , we are challenged\nto make a judgement. As the critical response to the film showed,\nthe challenge was far too disquieting and difficult for some.\n\f30    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nL\'(fjl du maUn\n\nAfter Les Bonnes Femmes - only 84,000 tickets sold in Paris -\nChabrol could hardly afford another failure at the box office. In\ncommercial terms, his career was in free-fall. The situation\nworsened with the release of the black comedy Les Godelureaux\n (1960). According to Chabrol, this was a useless film about\nuselessness (ibid.: 13). The public obviously agreed: a mere 23,000\nwatched it. However, the film\'s producer, Georges de Beauregard\n- who went on to finance Landru in 1962 and La Ligne de demar-\ncation in 1966 - was not disheartened. He supported Chabrol\'s\nnext project, L\'(Eil du malin (1961), although the film eventually\nhad to be shot for half the original (rather modest) budget,\nbecause of problems with the German co-producer. Accepting the\nchallenge, Chabrol shot the film frugally, mainly in and around\nMunich. Luckily, his scenario (written without Gegauff this time)\ncalled for a small cast, very few group shots, and a limited number\nof locations. The film was shot quicker and cheaper than any of\nChabrol\'s work since Le Beau Serge. This may have been of some\nconsolation when it proved another commercial disaster.\n    L\'(Eil du malin is narrated throughout by Albin Mercier\n(Jacques Charrier). A young French journalist, he is sent on assign-\nment to a village in Bavaria. There he meets a French woman,\nHelene Hartmann (Stephane Audran in the first of her \'Helene\'\nroles), and her husband Andreas (WaIter Reyer), a successful\nGerman writer. Andreas is everything that Albin is not but wants\nto be: famous, wealthy, physically and intellectually strong, and\nmarried to the beautiful HeIene. Albin is an outsider in this world,\nnot only unable to speak German but also placed outside the\napparently idyllic bourgeois lifestyle of the Hartmanns: he is\nfrequently shown lingering by their wall or gate, looking in at what\nhe imagines to be \'un univers rond, parfait, OU tout est harmon-\nieux\'y Gradually he befriends the couple and enters ever deeper\ninto their house and their lives. Discovering that HeIene is having\nan affair behind Andreas\'s back, Albin first tries to blackmail her\ninto leaving her husband. When she refuses, he shows Andreas\n\n31 \'a perfect, rounded universe, where everything is in harmony\'\n\f                                                        THE NEW WAVE          31\n\n\nthe photos he has taken of the lovers, with the result that Andreas\nmurders his wife. Albin is again alone, outside the gates, as\nAndreas is taken away by the police. He has destroyed the very\nharmony that he envied.\n     In many ways, L\'(Eil du malin is the one ftlm from Chabrol\'s\nnew-wave period which best prefigures his later work. Two staple\nthemes of his mature cinema are presented here: first, the dis-\nruption of an apparently perfect couple to reveal hidden truths and\ntensions behind the fa~ade of bourgeois harmony (this recurs in\nLa Femme infidele, Le Cri du hibou, L\' Enfor, and La C6remonie). This\ntheme is qualified by the second, since the revealer of unwanted\ntruths, the outsider/avenger figure, is not unequivocally heroic: he\nis in many ways destructive, a voyeur whose gaze brings death, a\ncoward and a manipulator who is afraid to engage fully with life\n(hence hiding his real identity and real motives behind masks and\npseudonyms). Thus Andre Mercier (alias Albin) ressembles\nCharles Thenier (alias Marc Andrieux) in Que la bete meure, as well\nas Wolf in Masques and Forestier in Le Cri du hibou. He may see\nthrough appearances - \'Ainsi, ce bonheur, cette harmonie que\nj\'enviais, tout n\'etait que mensonge et tromperie\'P - but he also\nengineers their brutal destruction.\n    The central motif in the film is of penetration and entry:\nspecifically, Albin\'s entry into the Hartmanns\' private space (a\nmetaphor for his sexual desire for Helene and an expression of his\nwish to belong). This is reiterated verbally by his commentary -\n\'j\'allais penetrer chez eux\'; \'mon but etait de penetrer dans\nl\'univers de cet couple\'; \'je voulais penetrer en fraude\'ll - and\nvisually by his gradual exploration of the Hartmanns\' home: first\nthe wall and gate, then the garden, the ground floor of the house\n(when invited to dinner), and finally (by a ruse) the first floor,\nwhere the more intimate space of bedroom and bathroom is\nfound. While Andreas is away on business, Albin assumes his\nplace in the house: taking a bath, wearing his bathrobe, sitting in\n\n32 \'So, the happiness and harmony that 1 had envied was nothing more than lies\n   and deceit\'\n33 \'I was going to enter their house\'; \'my goal was to enter the universe of this\n   couple\'; \'I wanted to sneak in secretly\'\n\f32     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n his chair and drinking his brandy. The sequence ends with his\n triumphant comment (in voice-over), Tetais devenu leur intime\'.l"\n But rather than enable him to replace Andreas permanently, as he\n perhaps hopes, Albin\'s blackmail plan only leaves him alone on\n the outside again. The mise en scene of Helene\'s murder is worth\ndwelling upon. Like the opening sequence of Le Cri du hibou\n (1987), the murder scene recalls the action of watching a film in a\ndarkened cinema. Albin (like Forestier in Le Cri du hibou) hides in\na dark garden looking up at the well-lit windows of a house. In this\ncase, Helene staggers out of the house on to the first-floor\nveranda, stares into space (towards Albin and the audience) and\nthen collapses, her throat cut. The equation between Albin and\nourselves (suggested by the composition but also by Helene\'s\ngaze, which addresses both) emphasises that he - like us - has\nalways been outside looking in, a tolerated voyeur rather than a\ntrue \'intime\'.l5\n    The first of Chabrol\'s films to owe a clear debt to Hitchcock,\nL\'CEi/ du malin reprises the sequence from Vertigo (1958) where\nJames Stewart, a detective, follows mysterious femme fatale Kim\nNovak.3 6 Here, Albin follows Helene to the secret rendez-vous\nwith her lover. (The camera Albin uses to photograph the two\ntogether recalls another Hitchcockian voyeur, the photographer-\nagain played by James Stewart - in Rear Window (1954).) As in Les\nBonnes Femmes, during Albin\'s trailing of Helene the thriller\nelement is combined with neorealism: on the streets of Munich\nand at the beeifest, real crowds jostle the lead characters and\nChabrol\'s hand-held camera jolts and sways. There is no sound-\ntrack music, only the ambient noise of the festival itself. But the\nrest of the film is much more stylised than Les Bonnes Femmes.\nThis comes from the fact that L\'CEil du malin represents Albin\'s\nromanticised account of events rather than an objective, realistic\nrecord. In Chabrol\'s words. \'L\'histoire etait vue par un minable, et\n\n\n34 "had become intimate with them\'\n35 \'close friend\'\n36 Vertigo is also alluded to when Albin finds HeIime in the woods. L\'Enfer (1994)\n   also refers to Vertigo - see Chapter 5.\n\f                                                         THE NEW WAVE          33\n\nle film etait forcement, en un sens minable\'l7 (ibid.: 14). L\'CBi! du\nmalin is a pathetic film because it is a subjective one. And Albin is\npathetic throughout: in his attempts to enter the Hartmanns\'\nworld and in his petulant revenge on that world when he is\nexcluded from it (the blackmail plot, but also his desire to avenge\nhis embarrassment when the Hartmanns discover that he cannot\nswim). It is not just the voice-over that indicates Albin\'s control\nover the narrative, and that gives certain events a revised meaning\n(exaggerating the Hartmanns\' affection for him, insisting on the\nduplicity of Helene\'s affair when the images of it remain light,\nnatural, almost innocent). At times it is the images too. Hence the\nrepeated shot of him walking home in the evening from the\nHartmanns\' house: \'Lorsqu\' Albin Mercier descend la pente en\ncontre-jour, c\'est que, lui, il se voit ainsi. C\'est surement le type\nqui ne peut pas descendre une pente sans se voir aureole d\'un\nmagnifique contre-jour\'l8 (ibid.: 15). One might even ask whether\nthe penultimate scene, in which Albin begs Andreas\'s forgive-\nness, is not simply a fantasy, in which Albin says what he should\nhave said and so absolves himself of the sense of guilt he feels. As\nthe conclusion suggests, the guilt remains, alongside a newfound\nself-awareness. Albin\'s final voice-over declares, \'Je ne peux pas\nm\'empecher de raconter cette histoire, et les gens me demandent\npourqui un gan;:on aussi sympathique que moi prend plaisir ase\nsalir les mains\',39 As he has finally realised, and as we have learned\nduring the telling of the tale, Albin is very far from being \'un\ngarc;:on sympathique\'.4o\n\n\n37 \'The story was seen through the eyes of a pathetic loser, and the film was\n   therefore, in one sense, pathetic\'\n38 \'When Albin Mercier is back-lit as he walks down the hill, it\'s because he sees\n   himself like that. He is exactly the sort of person who can\'t walk down a hill\n   without seeing himself basking in the glow of a magnificent light behind him.\'\n   Compare the romantic images ofFran~ois (lit by haloes) in the closing section of\n   Le Beau Serge and of Charles (picked out by melancholy tracking-shots) in the\n   central section of Que la belt meure.\n39 \'I can\'t stop myself from telling this story, and people ask me why a nice young\n   man like me is so keen to wallow in the dirt\'\n40 There is an added irony here at the expense ofJacques Charrier\'s star image: his\n   usual roles were in fact \'gar~ons sympathiques\' (see Chabrol 1976: 159).\n\f34     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n   Was cam du malin another example - after A double tour and\nLes Bonnes Femmes - of Chabrol being too clever for his audience?\n It was certainly another nail in his coffin as a successful new-wave\ndirector. He has said of the film that it ran up against \'une terrible\nchose: le fait que le cinema est obligatoirement un art de masse\'4 1\n (ibid.: 16). This was to be drummed home with the failure of\n Ophelia (1962), which became Chabrol\'s fourth consecutive com-\nmercial disaster since A double tour. The figures for the Paris box\noffice reveal a steady and apparently terminal decline: 130,000 for\nA double tour, 84,000 for Les Bonnes Femmes, 23,000 for Les\nGodelureaux, 14,000 for L\'(Bil du malin and 12,000 for Ophelia\n(Braucourt 1971: 177).4\' The lesson Chabrol was to take out of the\nnew-wave period was that a director - whether he considered\nhimself an auteur or not - could not disregard the tastes of the\nmass audience and continue to make popular films. The choice\nseemed to be between popular cinema (meaning genre cinema)\nand the artistic ghetto. It was a dilemma faced by the other new-\nwave directors too, and which saw Godard, Rivette and Rohmer\nremain in the ghetto with only Truffaut successfully managing to\ncombine art and commerce. Unlike Truffaut, Chabrol was not yet\nin this position, but he was to get there by spending the five years\nafter Ophe1ia making genre films: the (admittedly macabre) period\ndrama Landru (1963), the spy films Le Tigre aime la chair fraiche\n(1964) and Le Tigre se paifume ala dynamite (1965), the war film La\nLigne de demarcation (1966) and so on. In these wilderness years,\nhe was rejected by Cahiers du cinema and generally held to be the\ndisgrace of the new wave. Although new-wave idols like Hitchcock\nand Lang, Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks had worked entirely\nin popular genres, when Chabrol began to do so he ceased to be\nregarded as an auteur.\n    Although he was in this way the first to leave the new wave,\nChabrol had made a major contribution to it, first as a critic and\nthen, more significantly, as both director and producer. There are\n\n41 \'a terrible thing: the fact that cinema is by definition an art for mass consump-\n   tion\'\n42 The figures for L\'CEil du malin and Les Godelureaux are in fact estimates, since\n   the number of entries was not high enough to be computed exactly!\n\f                                                THE NEW WAVE       35\n\ncompeting views as to which film launched the nouvelle vague -\nAgnes Varda\'s La Pointe courte in 1954, Godard\'s A bout de souffle\nin 1959,Truffaut\'s Les 400 coups winning at Cannes the same year\n- but Le Beau Serge, shown on the fringes at Cannes in 1958 and\nhailed by Truffaut that summer as a turning-point in French\ncinema, probably has the best claim. In the films that followed,\nChabrol experimented with film form, neorealism, editing and\ncamerawork, genre and spectatorship in a manner which exem-\nplifies new-wave cinema. Ironically, in late 1962 when his new-\nwave pedigree was threatened, and in his last Cahiers interview for\ntwenty years, Chabrol defended the films ofTruffaut and Godard\nand called for the nouvelle vague to regroup and work together\nagain (Collet and Tavernier 1962: 19). The subsequent year did, in\nfact, see him working with Godard, each contributing a sketch to\nLes plus belles escroqueries du monde (1963). But by this time his\ncareer was in serious jeopardy. Apart from this 18·minute sketch,\nChabrol shot nothing at all between July 1962 and April 1964.\nWhen he did return to film-making, it was no longer as a new-\nwave auteur, but as a commercial director of genre films. His way\nback into the industry was to be the spy movie Le Tigre aime la\nchair fratche.\n   The final fling of the new wave was the portmanteau film Paris\nvu par ... (1964). It featured six sketches, by directors such as Eric\nRohmer, Jean-Luc Godard and Jean Rouch. Chabrol contributed\nwhat is acknowledged as the best episode of the six, La Muette.\nThis last, isolated example of Chabrol\'s new-wave cinema is\nsandwiched in his filmography between the commercial spy films\nLe Tigre aime la chair frafche and Marie-Chantal contre Dr Kha\n(1965). He was now making films for producers who - in\nshocking contrast with the new-wave ideal of the self-sufficient\nauteur, an ideal he himself had once epitomised - considered\nhim as their servant (Biette et at. 1982: 9). But Chabrol did not\nregard this as a defeat. Rather, he tried to learn from the workings\nof popular cinema, and began to question the cult of the self·\npenned screenplay: \'il y a des types qui se sentent absolument\nhonteux d\'avoir atoumer le scenario d\'un autre. Pourqui pas? <;:a\npeut etre interessant, on n\'est pas le seul a pouvoir ecrire un\n\f36     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nscenario\'4J (ibid.: 10). Four of the seven films that Chabrol was to\nmake in the aftermath of the new wave - the two Tigres, Le\nScandale (1966) and La Route de Corinthe (1967) - were shot with-\nout any contribution to the screenplay from Chabrol or his usual\nscriptwriter, Paul Gegauff. But Chabrol deliberately kept his film\ncrew together during this time, and when he emerged from his\nperiod in artistic exile it was to shoot what are probably the\ngreatest films of his career, the superb Helene cycle.\n\n\n\nReferences\nBiette.

His contribution to the movement,\nboth as producer and director, was eclipsed by the apparently\ntawdry spectacle of the commercial films that he made after\nOphe1.ia. The professionalism and expertise that he lavished on spy\nfilms and outrageous thrillers between 1964 and 1967 seemed\nmerely to confirm that he was no auteur but simply a director for\nhire. Yet his period in the wilderness served to develop his tech-\nnical skill and his grasp of genres, and led directly to his mature\nstyle in the Heli~ne cycle Of1968-71. None the less, the intellectual\npress in France, and in particular Cahiers du cinema, treated even\nthis flowering of Chabrol\'s talent with almost as much disdain as\nthey had shown for the espionage films a few years earlier. The\ndominance of Marxist, Maoist and structuralist concerns at\nCahiers du cinema during the late 1960s is largely to blame.\nChabrol\'s tendency towards classical cinema - in contrast with the\nfashionable and more explicitly ideological experimentation of\nResnais, Rivette or Godard - was considered too close to the tradi-\ntion de qua/iti (the old-fashioned cinema of quality) that Cahiers\nand the new wave had always fought against. As a consequence,\nfilms as important as Les Biches (1967) and La Femme injidele (1968)\nwere granted barely a page and a half together, while Cahiers did\n\n I   \'I was the shame, the shame of the family\'\n\f                                                  THE HELENE CYCLE           43\n\nnot interview Chabrol once between 1962 and 1982.\' More sur-\nprising was the widespread misreading ofChabrol\'s use ofbour-\ngeois settings and characters. L\'Express, Le Nouvel Observateur and\nCahiers du cinema all remained blind to the sly critique of the\nbourgeoisie in films such as Les Biches and La Femme injidele,\nchoosing instead to detect in Chabrol\'s work a celebration of the\nmiddle classes. In a review of Que la bete meure (1969) for Le\nNouvel Observateur entitled \'La bouffe et la bagnole\' ,3 Michel\nMardore chastised Chabrol for having lost any critical distance on\nthe bourgeoisie that he once had, and for becoming an apologist\nfor the status quo. This represents both a breath-takingly wrong-\nheaded interpretation of Que la bete meure - where, as we shall see,\nthe ritual of \'la bouffe\' is characterised as a torturous experience\nwhile \'la bagnole\' is an instrument of death - and a misrepre-\nsentation of Chabrol\'s politics. Similarly oblivious to the ways in\nwhich Chabrol\'s brand of popular, classical cinema was able to\nundermine \'the system\' from within, Pascal Kane asked in Cahiers:\n\'Beaucoup plus victime du "systeme" qu\'il ne semble le croire,\nChabrol prendra-t-il un jour ses distances?\'4 (Kane 1969: 55). The\npolitical subtext of Les Biches - a film which concerns the possibi-\nlity of revolution against the status quo - was either too pessim-\nistic to be greeted with approval, or was simply ignored. So too was\nChabrol\'s contribution to the revolutionary spirit of May 1968,\nincluding Project 4, his radical proposal that cinema entry be free,\nuncensored, and paid for by taxation.\n    Chabrol\'s apparent willingness in the mid-196os to compro-\nmise the supposed artistic purity and personal vision of the auteur\nbecame evident not just in his pursuit of commercial projects, but\nin his acceptance of the constraints of popular genres (spy film,\nthriller, melodrama) and in his continuing emphasis on the\n\n\n 2In marked contrast, the British press. and above all Sight and Sound, featured\n  long interviews and favourable reviews for Chabrol\'s work during the same\n  period.\n3 \'Nosh and motors\'\n4 \'One day, will Chabrol- much more a victim of "the system" than he seems to\n  think - actually distance himself from it?\'. The answer has proved to be a\n  resounding \'no\'.\n\f44    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\ncollective nature of film-making. He was chastised in Cahiers for\nhis reliance on generic models, seen as precluding any \'evocation\nd\'un univers personnel\'s (ibid.: 55). But Chabrol\'s fascination with\ngenre remained, as did his loyalty to his film crew. The team that\nhe had gathered around him early in his career was kept together\nfor film after film, year after year, no matter what the project\nmight be. Jean Rabier\'s photography, Pierre Jansen\'s music, and\nJacques Gaillard\'s editing were thus perfected during the wilder-\nness years in the same way that Chabrol\'s own directorial style\nwas. To these were added the continued collaboration with Paul\nGegauff on screenplays, and the increasing importance of Stephane\nAudran, alongside actors such as Michel Bouquet, Jean Yanne,\nMichel Duchaussoy, Mario David, Henri Attal and Dominique\nZardi. The Helene cycle - strictly speaking, comprising La Femme\ninfidele, Que la bete meure, Le Boucher, La Rupture and Juste avant la\nnuit - sees Audran cast repeatedly in the central role as the often\ninscrutable Helene. 6 The principal male roles, mostly incarnated\nby Bouquet and Yanne, repeat the contrasting figures of Les\nCousins: the evil but charismatic Paul and the angelic, timid Charles\n(parodies of Gegauff and Chabrol respectively). Within the\ntriangular relationships that result, Chabrol explores questions of\nidentity, guilt, and class tension, with a degree of precision and\ncraftsmanship at that point unprecedented in his career.\n\n\n\nLes Biches\nChabrol has said that he never felt bitter about his difficulties in\nthe 1960s, since \'J\'ai d\'ailleurs toujours pense que ma veritable\ncarriere commencerait avec la quarantaine\'7 (Braucourt 1971: 134).\nIn 1967, at the age of 37, he found that his prediction was becom-\ning true. Thanks to the support of the young producer Andre\n5 \'evocation of a personal world-view\'\n6 The exception here is Que la bite meure, in which Audran does not star. Contrary\n  to some accounts, however, there is a Heli~ne in the film, played by Caroline\n  Cellier. Les Noces rouges, in which Audran plays the mother of a girl called\n  Helene, is in some ways a coda to the cycle, as explained in Chapter 4.\n7 \'I\'ve always thought that my real career would start round about the age of forty\'\n\f                                            THE HELENE CYCLE        45\n\n Genoves - who went on to finance Chabrol\'s next eleven films -\nhe was able to shoot Les Biches, \'the first film which I made exactly\nas I wished\' (Nogueira and Zalaffi 1971: 3). Co-written by Chabrol\nand Gegauff, starring Stephane Audran in the lead role, and\n showing the influence of Fritz Lang (in the expressionist decor\nand the theme of revenge), Les Biches is the first film of Chabrol\'s\nmature style, and heralds the superb film-making of the Helene\ncycle. It concerns the rich and manipulative Frederique (Audran),\nwho picks up a young pavement artist called Why (Jacqueline\n Sassard) in Paris and takes her home to StTropez. A lesbian affair\ndevelops, but is complicated by the presence of Paul (Jean-Louis\nTrintignant), with whom both women fall in love. The uneasy\nmenage atrois is brutally put to an end when Frederique and Paul\nleave for Paris. Why follows, murders Frederique, assumes her\nidentity, and awaits the arrival of Paul. The film has often been\ncompared to Les Cousins (1958), since they both explore the power\nrelations between two friends who are rivals in love. But there are\nthree crucial differences. In Les Cousins, the rivals are male and\nthe object of desire female - these gender roles are reversed in Les\n Biches. This allows a portrayal of female sexuality as predatory and\nactive in the latter film, while it is passive and victimised in the\nformer. Secondly, and as a result, where Les Cousins is a variant on\nthe myth of the town mouse and the country mouse, Les Biches is a\nvariant on the myth of the lesbian vampire. The third distinction is\nin the realm of politics: for all the explicit references to Fascism,\nLes Cousins does not lend itself to a clear political reading; Les\nBiches, on the other hand, can be justly described as a political\nfilm. As Chabrol has said, the subject \'isn\'t really a power struggle.\nIt\'s a revolution: the replacement of one class by another\' (Yakir\n1979: 9)·\n    The first motif to be introduced in Les Biches is the archetype of\nthe lesbian vampire. Andrea Weiss has noted that \'the typical\nlesbian vampire film _.. has certain fairly consistent characteristics:\nGothic themes and images, large empty castles and dark, roman·\ntic landscapes, and the arrival, early in the film, of a mysterious,\naristocratic figure\' (Weiss 1992: 85). While the Gothic themes and\nsettings have undergone a modernisation in Chabrol\'s film, they\n\f46   CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nremain, in modified form: the drama of desire, possession and\nmurder is played out in Frederique\'s villa, a contemporary castle\ncomplete with obsequious servants and an array of weapons\n (including the poisoned dagger which Why uses at the end of the\nfilm). More explicitly generic is the characterisation ofFrederique.\nShe is presented from the first sequence as the typically \'mysteri-\nous, aristocratic\' vampire of convention. Chabrol\'s mise en scene\nhere is unequivocal. Dressed in black boots, a long black coat and\na black hat, Frederique wanders on to the Pont des Arts, her world-\nweary air heightened by her pale make-up and the black kohl\nround her eyes. She is looking for a victim. The misty, sepia tones\nof the photography here and Pierre Jansen\'s eerie music unmis-\ntakably recall the melancholy vampire films of German express-\nionism. More naturalistic colour soon intervenes, but the point\nhas been made. Even when the film leaves the horror genre (after\nthe prologue), the relationship between Frederique and Why is\nclearly vampiric, centring as it does on the theme of possession,\nand the appropriation of one woman by the other. At first it is\nFrederique who appropriates Why - she literally buys her body.\nBut as the narrative develops, Why gradually begins to appropriate\nFrederique\'s clothing, jewellery, voice, sexual pleasure (the bed-\nroom scene) and, ultimately, her identity. When she kills Frederique\n(and puts on the black coat from the first sequence), the vampiris-\nation is complete. To this extent, Les Biches is reminiscent of other\nEuropean films of the period, such as Bergman\'s Persona (1965)\nor Fassbinder\'s The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972), wherein\n\'vampirism is suggested through the erotic relationship between\ntwo women, in which one woman takes over the personality or\nsoul of the other\' (ibid.). Chabrol\'s repeated use of mirrored com-\npositions, and his close attention to costume in the film, under-\nlines this exchange of personalities: as Frederique changes from\nlesbian vampire to heterosexual woman, she dresses no longer in\nblack but in white; Why makes the opposite change, from sexual\ninnocent (in white) to lesbian vampire (in black). The mise en scene\nhere would seem to suggest a demonising of lesbianism, in line\nwith generic conventions: \'The lesbian vampire provokes anxieties\nin the heterosexual male spectator, only for the film to quell these\n\f                                            THE HELENE CYCLE       47\n\n\nanxieties and reaffirm his maleness through the vampire\'s violent\ndestruction\' (ibid.: 90). It would therefore seem that the threat of\nthe lesbian vampire is destroyed with the murder of Frederique.\n But despite first appearances, the ending of Les Biches goes against\nthe grain. The film ends with continuation, not closure; the threat\nof the lesbian vampire is not contained but in fact renewed, since\nalthough the original (Frederique) is killed, she is in fact no longer\na lesbian (or a vampire). She has already been vampirised and\nreplaced by the copy (Why). Frederique is thus punished not as a\njudgement on her lesbianism, but because she has \'gone straight\'\nand betrayed Why in order to fulfill her (heterosexual) love of Paul.\nAnd, as the final image of the film suggests, far from enjoying the\nvampire\'s \'violent destruction\', Paul himselflooks set to become\nher next victim.\n    In the \'bisexual triangle\' of the archetypal lesbian vampire film,\nthe vampire\'s female victim \'is usually a "nice, sweet girl" ... who is\nmerely a receptacle to assume the values\' of the predatory lesbian\nand/or the male suitor (ibid.: 92). In Les Biches, Why certainly\nassumes this position. But Chabrol maps on to this archetype the\nquestion of political (rather than just sexual and moral) values.\nThe film thus becomes a political vampire narrative about the\nappropriation of Frerlerique\'s bourgeois values by the innocent\nand impoverished \'receptacle\' that is Why. The brilliance of Les\nBiches lies in this portrayal of the embourgeoisement of the working\nclasses through the metaphor of a vampire breeding new vam-\npires. The vampirising in the film is thus doubled by class and\npower as well as by sex. When Frerlerique first meets Why, the\nsexual and economic power relations between them are expressed\nspatially: Why kneels at Frederique\'s feet, drawing does on the\npavement. Leaning on the bridge, Frerlerique tosses a bank note\non to the ground: the vampire has bought her next victim. In this\nbrief opening sequence, Chabrol combines the mythical power of\nthe vampire with the economic power of money (and class: the\nvampire is of course an \'aristocratic figure\', her victim penniless\nand possibly homeless). The twin themes of vampirism and\nembourgeoisement are succinctly expressed in the motif of\nreplication which runs through Les Biches. In the prologue, after\n\f48    ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n Frederique has picked up Why, they stop by the Seine to look at\nsome prints. When Frederique asks why two identical prints are\npriced differently, she is informed that the expensive one is the\noriginal and the cheap one is a copy. Crucially, Frederique is\nhowever unable to tell them apart. The implications for the narra-\ntive are clear: in terms of politics and vampirism, the expensive\noriginal (Frederique) will be replaced by the cheap copy (Why),\nwithout anyone (not even Paul?) being able to tell the difference.\n    If the episode with the print-seller functions as a clue to the\ndevelopment of the narrative, so too - in more explicitly political\nterms - does the first scene set in St Tropez. It is characteristic of\nChabrol, particularly in the carefully crafted Helene cycle, to\ninclude in his films miniature versions of the main narrative.\nThese are often texts which operate as clues to the meaning of the\nfilm, and also as idealised models against which the behaviour of\nthe characters is implicitly compared. The compromised revenge\nnarrative of Que la bete meure, for example, is measured against\nHomer\'s Iliad, an idealised account of heroism and vengeance. In\nLe Boucher, Helene\'s desire for romance is expressed in the form\nof the Balzac dictation that she gives her class, and against which\nPopaul can only be found wanting. 8 The idealised text in Les Biches\nis the revolutionary tract read aloud by Riais (Dominique Zardi) as\nWhy and Frederique approach the villa, and which concludes with\nthe lines: \'La revolution, c\'est un soulevement, un acte de violence\npar lequel une classe en renverse une autre\'.9 It is against this\nideal that Why\'s actions will be measured. At first it seems that\nWhy is indeed planning to overthrow her bourgeois mistress:\nseveral scenes show her resentment at being treated as a sexual\nobject-cum-servant. But as the mise en scene of the film makes\nabundantly clear, when the moment comes, Why does not achieve\na true revolution. Far from overthrowing Frederique, she copies\nher, wearing her clothes and speaking in her voice. In Chabrol\'s\nwords, \'Why replaces Frecierique, but she does it by becoming\n\n 8 For more on these two examples. see the accounts of the two films, below, pp. 55\n   and 62..\n 9 \'Revolution is an an upheaval, an act of violence by means of which one class\n   overthrows another\'\n\f                                                        THE HELENE CYCLE            49\n\nFrederique\' (Yakir 1979:9).\'° Revolution in Les Biches is thus simply\na reiteration of the status quo, a repetition, in which the proletariat\nsimply become the new ruling class. The point is driven home\nwhen Riais discovers Why dressed as Frederique. To his assertion\nthat \'Je suis un revolutionnaire, moi, quand quelque chose me\ndeplait, je renverse!\', Why replies, \'Mais je suis tres bien comme\ns:a, moi\'." Her own reaction to the subservient position she finds\nherself in is not to revolt so much as to imitate (to become\nFrederique). That Riais is in fact no revolutionary but merely a\nhanger-on, an annoying and parasitic dilettante, only increases\nthe pessimism of Chabrol\'s political prognosis in the film. With\nWhy simply a cheap copy of the bourgeois original, Paul a\ncalculating social climber (trading up from Why to Frederique),\nand Robegue and Riais (the intellectual revolutionaries)" nothing\nmore than leeches, there seems to be no way of challenging the\npower of the bourgeoisie embodied by Frederique. Les Biches was\nreleased in March 1968. Far from ignoring the political questions\nof the time, Chabrol might in fact be said to have made a very\nastute prediction about the outcome of the social unrest which\nswept France a few weeks later. For the \'events\' of May 1968,\nalthough they brought about a great number of reforms, fell as far\nshort of genuine revolution as Why does in Les Biches.\n\n\n\nLa Femme injidele\nThe first film of the Helene cycle, strictly speaking, is La Femme\ninfidele (1968). Charles (Michel Bouquet) is the straight-laced but\ndecent husband and Heiene (Stephane Audran) the inscrutable,\nunfaithful wife. Although there is no Paul, the role of charismatic\nplayboy devolves to Victor (Maurice Ronet). Essentially, the triangle\n\n10   Italics in original.\n11   \'I\'m a revolutionary: when I don\'t like something, I overthrow it!\' - \'But I\'m fine\n     like this\'\n12   Despite several evasive statements by Chabrol. it seems clear that these two\n     characters are intended to lampoon French intellectuals of the time, and in\n     particular Alain Robbe·Grillet (,Robegue-Riais\').\n\f50    CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nestablished in Les Cousins remains, but with a twist. The male\nrivals are still analogous with Chabrol and Gegauff - Bouquet has\nsaid that his portrayal of Charles was based on the director\'s own\npersonality - but this time Charles is the murderer not the victim.\')\nThe second, and more shocking twist, is that the husband\'s\nmurder of his wife\'s lover actually resuscitates their dull marriage,\nand ironically reunifies their family even as he himself is taken\naway by the police. All the irony of this situation is captured in the\nsuperb and justly famous final shot, which will be discussed\nshortly. Written by Chabrol alone, La Femme infidele none the less\nshows the influence of his three mentors, Paul Gegauff, Fritz\nLang and Alfred Hitchcock. The characterisation of Charles and\nVictor, as we have noted, is Gegauffian. The plot also bears a resem-\nblance, not just to the triangles of Les Cousins and Les Biches (both\nco-written by GegaufI), but also to another Gegauff screenplay, for\nRene Clement\'s Plein Solei! (1959). Chabrol himself had originally\nwanted to film the source novel, Patricia Highsmith\'s The Talented\nMr Ripley, but the rights were offered to Clement instead. The\nresult was a cool and detached thriller which featured a typical\nGegauffian anti-hero in Tom Ripley - deceitful, theatrical, but\nvulnerable. (The character of Ripley in Plein Solei! is also the\nspiritual father of Albin Mercier in Chabrol\'s L\'Oei! du malin\n(1961): both men are defensive, lower-class hangers-on who are\nattracted by the wealth and leisure of their social \'betters\'; they\nshare a talent for manipulation and deceit, but also a vulnerability\nsymbolised by their fear of water and inability to swim.) Like La\nFemme infidele, Clement\'s Plein solei! features a sudden murder in\neveryday circumstances. In Plein Solei! Tom kills Phillip in mid\nconversation, during a casual game of poker; in La Femme infidele\nCharles clubs Victor to death between whiskeys, also in the middle\nof a banal, if awkward, conversation. In both films, the compla-\ncent victim is played by Maurice Ronet. What distinguishes\nChabrol\'s murder scene from Clement\'s is the exaggerated, parodic\n\n\n13 This may explain why the Gegauffian figure is not called Paul, since Chabrol has\n   stated that a Charles cannot be seen to kill a Paul. For more on this. see the\n   analysis of Que la bite rneure, below. p. 61.\n\f                                                 THE HElENE CYClE          51\n\n\nbanality of the conversation which precedes the murder, during\nwhich Charles asks Victor how many rooms there are in his\napartment, and Victor advises Charles to move from Versailles to\nNeuilly. As in the excruciating pre-dinner conversation from Que\nla bete meure, the polite but meaningless small-talk of bourgeois\netiquette is haunted by the threat of violence, the eruption of the\nsame brutal desires it is designed to hold in check (Charles\'s\nmurder of Victor, Paul\'s explosive entrance and angry outbursts).\n    Echoes of Hitchcock\'s Psycho (1960) have often been pointed\nout - and at times criticised - in the sequences of La Femme infidele\nfollowing Victor\'s murder, when Charles tries to dispose of the\nbody.\'4 A less obvious but more revealing Hitchcockian intertext is\nin fact Notorious (1946), a twisted love story which like La Femme\ninfidele centres on mutual guilt and mutual suspicion which\nthreaten the potential happiness of a romantic couple. Chabrol\nwrote about the film in the book on Hitchcock he co-authored with\nRohmer, and his comments throw light on the theme of speaking\none\'s love in La Femme infidele: \'The misfortune of the prota-\ngonists comes from the fact that as victims of their mutual\npreconceptions, they refuse to pronounce the saving "word". They\nfail to appreciate the virtue of this confession\' (Rohmer and\nChabrol 1957: 84). At the start of La Femme infidele, the \'saving\nword\' cannot be pronounced; it is blocked by He]{~ne\'s infidelity\nand Charles\'s suspicion. Thus, when he asks her if she loves him,\nshe avoids the question. By contrast, and ironically by means of\nthe murder of Helene\'s lover, the word can be pronounced at the\nclose of the film; hence the mutual declaration of love imme-\ndiately before Charles is arrested: \'Je t\'aime\' - \'Je t\'aime\' - \'Je\nt\'aime comme un fou\'.ls This narrative ofredemption also recalls\nthe plot of Lang\'s Clash by Night (1952), in which a marriage is\nsaved when an unfaithful wife (May) witnesses the ferocity of her\ndull but decent husband Jerry\'s love for her, expressed by means\nof his violence towards her playboy lover (Earl). In Lang\'s film, the\n\n\n14 Henri-Georges Clouzot\'s Les Diaboliques (1954) is also a probable influence\n   here, as well as a precursor to Psycho in several respects.\nIS "love you\' - \'I love you\' - \'I love you madly\'\n\f52    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nmurder of the lover is only figurative: May tells Jerry \'You\'re\nkilling him!\'; Earl becomes metaphorically dead for her soon\nafterwards. Chabrol takes this plot and pushes it to its logical\nextension, literalising the death of the lover. Characteristically for\nthis period (reflecting the embourgeoisement of his settings and\ncharacters in the 1960s), he also replaces Lang\'s working-class,\nneorealist setting (a fishing village) with a deceptively glossy\nbourgeois setting (the family home in Versailles).\n    Accusations that Chabrol had become an apologist for the\nbourgeoisie inevitably dogged La Femme infidele as they had Les\nBiches a year earlier. But although there is no exploration of class\ntensions in the former (the working class are completely absent,\napart from very minor characters such as the housekeeper), the\nfilm is far from a simple celebration of the bourgeois lifestyle.\nBeneath the glossy image of Helene and Charles\'s comfortable\nlife in Versailles (including conspicuous consumption of food and\ndrink, large house and garden, car, even the relative novelty of\ntelevision) there lurks a feeling of unease. At times this is simply a\nquestion of suspense, or at others of narrative irony, as in the\nchampagne toast to \'cette memorable journee\',16 which Michel\nimagines is a celebration of his school report, but is for both\nCharles and Helene a comment on her affair. But the prevailing\nsense of unease is also subtly and brilliantly evoked by Jean\nRabier\'s camerawork and Jacques Gaillard\'s editing. La Femme\ninfidele begins with a tracking shot, from left to right, revealing a\nlarge house, with a family group gathered in the front garden:\nCharles, his mother, Helene, and their son Michel, who runs up to\nthem with a bouquet of flowers. The bourgeois family is apparently\nsecure and idyllic. But as Charles says to his mother, \'Le moindre\nchangement dans mon mode de vie pourrait troubler cette\nharmonie\'.\'7 In the credit sequence which follows, the seductive\nimage of the family is blurred and then distorted beyond recogni-\ntion, in a prelude to the explosion of suspicion and guilt which will\nshatter the illusion of harmony immediately after the credits\n\n16 \'to this memorable day·\n17 \'The slightest change in my lifestyle could unsettle this harmony\'\n\f                                                      THE HELENE CYCLE            53\n\n (when Charles guesses the meaning of Helene\'s secret phone-\ncall). And when the status quo is threatened, it must be reasserted\nat any price. The camerawork, symbolism and the narrative\nfunction (alongside Charles himself) to achieve this return to\nharmony throughout the rest of the film. On the level of the\nnarrative, this means that Victor, the source of the disruption,\nmust be removed, so that Charles and Helene can speak their love\nat the end. On the level of metaphor, it involves the symbolism of\nthe missing jigsaw puzzle (the lack within the family which must\nbe repaired) and the T.S. Eliot poem that Charles watches on\ntelevision the day he follows Helene to Victor\'s flat: \'Here the\nimpossible union / Of spheres of existence is actual, / Here the\npast and the future / Are conquered, and reconciled\'. On the level\nof mise en scene, it means that the camera movements in the film\nare all submitted to a similar logic of returning to the beginning.\nThus the left-to-right tracking shots in the first half of the film,\nincluding the opening shot, are matched by tracking shots in the\nother direction in the closing stages. As Chabrol explains, this\nprinciple determined the shooting of the entire film: \'chaque\nmouvement est suivi de son inverse, si bien que tout finit par\nrevenir ala meme place. Achaque fois qu\'il y a un travelling avant,\nil est suivi d\'un travelling arriere ... ; de meme chaque panor-\namique gauche est suivi par un panoramique droite et ainsi de\nsuite\'18 (Braucourt 1971: 92). Hence also the systematic use of shot\n/ reverse-shot patterns in the dialogue scenes, and the breaking of\nthe 180 0 rule,\'9 for instance when Charles and Helene embrace\nafter the visit to the night-club.\n    Most unsettling are the tiny fissures in the editing, like cracks\nin the image of the idyllic family group at the start of the film.\nThese miniature jump-cuts are most evident in the murder of\nVictor (as his body falls) and the cleaning of the blood in the sink.\n18 \'each [cameral movement is followed by its opposite, so that everything comes\n   back to the point of departure. Each time there is a tracking forwards, it\'s\n   followed by a tracking back; in the same way each pan to the left is followed by a\n   pan to the right, and so on\'\n19 This is the classical realist convention that a scene, if shot from one side of its\n   central axis (the 180 degree line), will not suddenly be shot from the other side\n   (which would disrupt the construction of filmic space).\n\f54     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nThe editing of the first sequence after the credits is also troubling:\n as Charles bursts in on Heli~ne\'s phone conversation with Victor,\n the editing switches quickly and disconcertingly between a mid\n shot, a medium close-up, then a mid shot again, while the camera\n tracks rapidly from Charles to Helene and back again. There are\nother scenes which suggest a latent violence or an emptiness\nbeneath the glossy surface of the mise en scene: the long pause\nbefore Helene appears in the doorway of Charles\'s office, or the\nmoments, as Charles reflects on his wife\'s affair, when the ambient\nsound (traffic noises and so on) fades to be replaced by suspense-\nful music. These temporary disturbances are comparable to the\nbreak in the television programme that Charles watches early in\nthe film. A message on the screen declares \'Veuillez nous excuser\nde cette interruption momantanee de l\'image\'!O But in La Femme\ninfidele, \'normal service\' is only fully resumed in the doomed\nconclusion. There is a central irony here, as in Juste avant la nuit:\nbourgeois harmony, which must be preserved at all costs, is\nactually salvaged by murder. Thus the apparently calm and\n\'natural\' status quo rests on behind-the-scenes violence (even if\nthis violence is not explicitly politicised here, as it is in Les Biches\nand elsewhere). But there is an ambivalence in the film, as so\noften in Chabrol\'s work, since La Femme infidele is also a dark\nromance, in which love is rediscovered at the last moment. This\nromantic element (the Notorious theme) is expressed by reference\nto another film of Hitchcock\'s. As Chabrol explains, the final shot in\nLa Femme infidile uses a technique which Hitchcock had developed\nfor Vertigo - a simultaneous zoom forwards and tracking back-\nwards - to show a final glimpse of Helene and Michel, and to\nexpress the paradoxical situation in which Charles is emotionally\nreunited with them even as he is physically taken away from them\nby the police: \'C\'est un plan qui se contredit lui-meme! Mais c\'est\ntres beau, car c\'est de la que venait ou non le happy end. Si le\ntravelling arriere finissait avant le zoom avant, le film finissait\nbien puisqu\'on se rapprochait de la bonne femme. Mais si le\nzoom avant finissait avant le travelling arriere, le film finissait mal\n\n20   \'We apologise for the temporary loss of picture\'\n\f                                                        THE HELENE CYCLE             55\n\n\npuisqu\'on reculait\'\'\' (ibid.: 92). The result is the most famous\nexample of Chabrol\'s tendency to end his films with a moment of\nunsettling ambivalence rather than the expected narrative closure:\n\'people seem to think that the final shot explains everything when\nthe contrary is true. It is a question mark\' (Overbey I97T 81).\n\n\n\nQue la bete meure\n\nChabrol is a master of the pre·credit sequence, from the decept-\nively happy family group in La Femme infidele to the triple suicide\nin Dr M. The twenty-shot sequence that begins Que la bete meure\n(1969) is a case in point: expressive, economical, terrible. The\ncamera focuses on a young boy (Michel), then zooms back to show\nthe beach where he is playing. Cut to a harbour scene with a road\nin the background. As a black car comes into view, a melancholy\nsong by Brahms is heard. The car is driving very fast, from right to\nleft. Michel begins walking in the opposite direction (the two\nopposing tracking shots suggest that these two movements will\ninevitably collide). The camera follows the car again, from right to\nleft (a reversal of the direction of reading, of progression, hence\nimplying death)." A shot of the radio as the driver changes gear\nshows that the song is coming from the car radio (rather implaus-\nibly, given what we will learn about the character of the driver,\nPaul). A shot of the road from above the speeding car shows a\nhuge and ominous black bonnet; the top of the screen cuts off the\n\n\n2[   \'It\'s a shot which contradicts itself! It\'s a tracking backwards with a zoom\n     forwards! But it\'s very beautiful, since it\'s this shot which gives the film a happy\n     ending - or not. If the tracking backwards finished before the zoom forwards,\n     the film finished happily because you were getting nearer to the wife, But if the\n     zoom forwards finished before the tracking back. the film finished unhappily\n     because you were moving away.\' Chabral adds that in all three takes of this\n     ending, the zoom finished first, so the film ends unhappily. I would suggest that\n     the main effect, however, remains one of ambivalence, This is heightened by\n     the question of point of view: is the camera here subjective (Charles\'S point of\n     view) or objective\'\n22   See for example Susan Hayward\'s account of the right·to·left tracking shots in\n     Varda\'s Sans toit ni loi (Hayward and Vincendeau [987\' 290).\n\f56    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n road in the distance and the vanishing point, thus creating a sense\n of blindness, of ignorance in the face of fate, and also giving the\n impression that Paul will not see what is coming up. Michelleaves\n the beach and walks silently into the village. A shot of the\n passenger (Helene) from the back seat; Paul puts his arm round\n her as the car enters the village. The sound of bells as the camera\npans slowly along the village street from the church tower to\n Michel, walking in the middle of the road. The music is heard\nagain, loudly, as in quick succession, the church comes into view\nand Helene lurches across the car, grabbing the dashboard;\n Michel\'s face looms up; the car hits him; he falls to the ground\n (seen from above); Paul tells Helene to shut up as she turns round\nand begins to scream. Finally, Helene\'s point of view as she looks\nback at the scene of the accident. The sequence ends with a shot of\nMichel\'s body lying in the middle of the road as the car disappears.\nThe shot is held, in silence. As well as the brutal fact of the\naccident itself (which provides the impetus for all that follows),\nseveral other things are concisely expressed here, most notably the\nmystery of the driver\'s identity (we see Helene\'s face but only half\nof Paul\'s), the consequences of the crash for the two people in the\ncar (the impact is experienced from Helene\'s perspective rather\nthan from Paul\'s; subsequently she will have a breakdown while\nhe will deny that anything even took place); the sense of impla·\ncable fate and impending death (the song, the black car, the two\nmovements that collide, the truncated shot of the road ahead, the\nglimpse of the church, the sound of bells). The premise of the\nrevenge narrative, the idea of destiny and the almost inevitable\nprocess ofloss - the essential themes and emotions of the film -\nhave been expressed in less than three minutes.\n    The most perfect film of the accomplished Helene cycle, Que la\nbite meure is a piece of fearful symmetry, in which terrible emotions\nand brutal actions are framed in a classical pattern. The emotional\nstakes are high, since the narrative concerns the killing of a child\nand the avenging of his death. The passions involved are con-\ntrolled and accentuated by the poise of the mise en scene and the\ncyclical pattern of the plot. As Charles says at the close of the film,\n\'C\'est digne d\'une tragedie grecque. Un homme tue un enfant;\n\f                                                     THE HELENE CYCLE           57\n\nl\'enfant de cet homme le tuera a son tour\'.·3 Que la bite meure is in\nfact a Greek tragedy and a revenge narrative at once. On the one\nhand, the claustrophobic symmetry of the plot echoes classical\ndrama, while the poeticising of death and revenge in Charles\'s\ndiary is parodied by references to Homer\'s Iliad.· 4 On the other\nhand, the emotions evoked, and the character of the righteous but\nultimately indecisive and troubled avenger, recall Fritz Lang\'s The\nBig Heat (1953) and Rancho Notorious (1951), both of which tell \'the\nold story of hate, murder and revenge\'.·5 But Lang and Chabrol\nqualify the act of revenge, so that he who confronts a beast risks\nbecoming a beast himself As a result, both Que la bete meure and\nRancho Notorious subvert the cathartic act of vengeance on which\nthe revenge narrative is predicated - and which takes place, for\ninstance, in revenge westerns such as Mann\'s Winchester \'73 (1950).\nVern in Rancho Notorious and Charles in Que la hete meure spurn\nopportunities to kill the men they have remorselessly hunted down.\nIn the former case, Kinch is actually killed by Vern\'s friend\nFrenchy. In the latter, Charles mayor may not kill Paul (both\ninterpretations are possible), but the murder takes place off-\nscreen and is therefore invisible, repressed (as were bloody events\nin classical tragedy). The similarities with The Big Heat are even\nclearer: like Charles in Que la hete meure, Bannion is caught in a\ncircle of tragedy and repetition: destined to repeat the violence of\nhis adversary, he is only redeemed thanks to the sacrifice of\nanother (Debbie in The Big Heat, Philippe in Que la bete meure). In\nboth films, the death of the hero\'s wife is compounded by the\ndeath (or loss) of her substitute (Debbie, HeU~ne). This is com-\n\n23 \'It\'s worthy of a Greek tragedy. A man kills a child; the child of that man kills\n    him in turn.\' Charles is referring here to Philippe\'s apparent confession to\n    patricide. See below, p. 61, for the alternative explanation of Paul\'s murder.\n24 James Monaco interprets these Greek allusions, and especially \'the image in\n    The Wad of a spear through the back of the head\', as indicative of the \'paternal\n    and platonic love\' between Charles and Philippe. See Monaco: 1976, 2.73.\n2.5 Quotation taken from the theme song of Rancho Notorious. There are also\n    several echoes of Rancho Notorious in Les Biches, notably the sequences at\n    Frederique\'s villa in St Tropez, where she holds court much as Altar (Marlene\n    Dietrich) does at the Chuck·a·Luck ranch. Riais rides Robegue at the soiree like\n    Dietrich riding the deputy in the saloon steeple·chase.\n\f58     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\npounded for Charles by the loss of his substitute son, Philippe.\nChabrol makes several direct allusions to The Big Heat, notably the\nscene in the empty house, the enquiries at the garages, and\nCharles\'s cross-examination of Helene about Paul (comparable to\nBannion asking Debbie about Vince).\n    Que la bete meure pits an honourable and grieving Charles\n(Michel Duchaussoy) against the boorish and bullying Paul (Jean\nYanne) responsible for his son\'s death. The apparent simplicity of\nthe plot and the characterisation is gradually complicated, how-\never. Charles is not above using HeIene (Caroline Cellier) as a\nmeans to enter Paul\'s family circle. Once there, he twice finds\nhimself unable to kill Paul (either from cowardice or cunning,\naccording to one\'s interpretation of the plot). Moreover, when\nPaul is at last horribly murdered, his son Philippe is either respon-\nsible for an action that Charles, for all his talk of vengeance,\ncannot actually commit or, just as damningly, is allowed to spend\na night in the cells before Charles admits to the murder himself\n(again, both possibilities remain open). Ultimately, the film evokes\na pervasive sense of loss, in which not just Michel but also Paul\n(for all his abrasiveness, a not entirely unsympathetic character),\nHelene, Philippe and Charles himself are all destroyed by what\nhas happened. Charles\'s final letter to Helene emphasises the past\nconditional, the elegiac tense of the entire film: \'Si nous n\'avions\npas ete emportes par tout cela, je t\'aurais aime .. :26 The symmetry\nof both narrative and mise en scene makes this tragedy all the more\napparent. Charles finds a surrogate wife in Helene and a surrogate\nson in Philippe, only to lose both of them again. (The physical\nsimilarity between the two boys is striking. Michel is in fact played\nby Stephane di Napoli and Philippe by his older brother, Marc.)\nReminders of his dead son are everywhere, from the teddy-bear he\ncannot throwaway to the spectral silhouette of Philippe which\nhaunts the scene in Paul\'s garage. The narrative is in several ways\nrepetitious, with the (off-screen) murder of Paul as the central\npoint. On either side of this invisible apex, Charles loses both a\n\n\n26 \'If we hadn\'t been caught up in all this, I would have loved you: There are three\n   other examples of the past conditional in this short letter.\n\f                                             THE HELENE CYCLE        59\n\nson and a wife; he watches a film about death (the home movie\nand the television report); he is involved in an attempt to solve a\ncrime, in which a daring hypothesis proves to be true (Charles\'s\nsuggestion to the police that the killer is a garage owner; the\ndetective\'s suggestion to Charles that the diary is a deliberate alibi).\nTo the love scene with Helene early in the film corresponds the\nabsence oflove scene in the hotel at the end; the parallel with the\nformer increases the sense of absence and loss in the latter. Pierre\nJansen\'s superb, romantic music - often the soundtrack to Charles\'s\ndiary entries - evokes the continuing trauma of Michel\'s death,\nsince it presents a number of variations on the song from Brahms\nwhich plays during the fatal accident. There are also persistent\nsplashes of red throughout the film, each of which recalls Michel\'s\nblood on the road at the end of the credit sequence: the pen with\nwhich Charles writes his vengeful diary, the tones of the Breton\nlandscape, the lighting of the nightclub where he meets Helene,\nthe decor of Paul\'s living-room, the colour of Charles\'s sowester,\nand so on. Finally there is the camerawork, and in particular the\nuse of the zoom.\n    Barely used before Chabrol\'s period of technical experimen-\ntation in the mid 1960s spy films, zooms are central to his film\nstyle in the Helene cycle (see the final shot of La Femme infidele, or\nthe slow zoom in on the back of Helene\'s head in Le Boucher). In\nQue la bite meure, the claustrophobic repetitions of narrative,\nmusic and mise en scene are mirrored by the patteming of the\nzooms, which tend to come in pairs, the second of which reverses\nthe direction of the first. In other words, a zoom-in will be\nfollowed by a zoom-out, and vice versa. This is evident throughout\nthe film, often as a means of framing a given action (when Paul\nslips on the clifftop, a zoom-in on Charles\'s face is followed by a\nzoom-out from the rocks below) or an entire sequence (the\nepisode in Paul\'s garage is introduced by a zoom-out from a tree\nin blossom, and concludes with a zoom-in on the same tree). The\ntragic circle is completed in the sublime closing sequence, a\nrecreation of the ending of Lang\'s Moonfleet (1955), in which a\ndying man leaves behind his surrogate son and sails alone into the\ndawn. Chabrol\'s film has come full circle in three ways. First,\n\f60    ClAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nthere is the return - after so many variations in the film score - of\nthe Brahms song, the song of death. Second, the camerawork - a\nzoom-out from Charles as he sails away - repeats the opening\nshot, a zoom-out from Michel playing on the beach. And third, for\nthe final shot, the camera actually sweeps in a huge circle over the\nsea before coming to rest on the crashing waves, thus encapsula-\nting the movement of the film, and symbolising three deaths: that\nofMichel\'s mother (more or less absent from the film but present\nin the homonym la mer/mere),\'7 that of Michel (who died walking\nhome from the sea) and the potential death of Charles himself (as\nimplied by the Moonjleet intertext and the quotation from Brahms:\n\'11 faut que la bete meure, mais l\'homme aussi\').,8\n    This is not to say, however, that Que la bere meure is purely\nrepetitious. There is a fundamental development within the film\nwhich concerns the question of perspective and identification.\nThe pre-credit sequence, analysed above, is scrupulously objective,\nin that it avoids presenting the accident from any character\'s point\nof view (there is only one shot out of the twenty which is possibly\nidentifiable as subjective: the glance back at the crossroads which\nmay belong to Helene; above all, Chabrol carefully avoids giving\nany shots from Michel\'s point of view). This objective style of\nfilming, typical of Lang and of Chabrol at his most Langian, is\nhowever suspended after the credit sequence. From this point\nuntil the murder of Paul. Chabrol encourages the spectator to\nidentify with Charles\'s perspective. This is facilitated by the emo-\ntive nature of Charles\'s position, and by the conventional use of\npoint-of.view shots whereby we see what Charles sees. But Chabrol\ngoes further than this in building up a subjective narration which\n-like Albin\'s story in L\'(Ei! du malin - includes the use of music,\ncommentary and camerawork. Hence the instances when Charles\'s\ndiary entries are not only given in voice-over, but are also accom-\npanied by Jansen\'s tragic score (based on Brahms) and by long,\nslow pans (usually from right to left, towards death) across the\nBreton countryside (itselfbleak and red tinged, a pathetic fallacy to\nreflect Charles\'s state of mind). Immediately after the opening\n27 sea/mother\n28 \'The beast must die. but the man also\'\n\f                                            THE HELENE CYCLE       61\n\n\ncredits, the movement from objectivity to subjectivity is apparent:\nas Charles begins to write his revenge diary, we hear sombre music,\nand then the first entry, \'Je vais tuer un homme\',\'9 in voice-over.\nCharles\'s face is shot in close-up against a background of trees\n(moving right to left); although this is simply explained by his\npresent situation (sat in a moving taxi), it also heralds the dramatic\npanoramas that will punctuate his search for the killer. There\nfollows a shot of the taxi driver from Charles\'s point of view, and\nthen in a simple but expressive movement, the camera shifts from\nCharles\'s face to the trees outside, suggesting that this landscape\nis to a degree subjective (the pathetic fallacy again).\n    Unexpectedly and crucially, although Chabrol films much of\nthe hunt for Paul in this manner, he does not represent Paul\'s\nmurder subjectively - in fact, it is not represented directly at all,\nwhile the police enquiry which follows is filmed objectively. Only\nin the coda - in which Charles repays Philippe\'s sacrifice and con-\nfession with his own - does the subjective narration (music, voice-\nover, slow pans) return. But the identification with Charles already\nestablished in the first half of the film enables Chabrol to pull off\nthe major twist in the tale - Philippe\'s confession, and hence the\npossibility of two conflicting interpretations of the murder (revenge\nor patricide). Objectively speaking, Charles is the murderer: hence\nhis boast to Paul that \'C\'est comme si tu etais mort\',lO his hearty\nappetite when Paul has thrown him out and thus apparently\nthwarted him, and the uneasiness of Philippe\'s confession, during\nwhich he stares at Charles and refuses to look at the detective. But\nCharles\'s temporary connivance in Philippe\'s account, and the\nidentification with Charles established by the subjective narration,\nencourages the spectator to make an erroneous (if plausible)\ninterpretation and to accept Philippe\'s false confession in order to\nfree Charles from guilt and imprisonment. Any confusion raised\nby Chabrol\'s remark that \'you\'ll never see a Charles kill a Paul\'\n(Nogueira and Zalaffi 1971: 6) should be dispelled by two facts:\nfirst, the murder takes place off-screen, and second, Charles acts\nunder his pen name, Marc Andrieu. In a quite brutal objective\n29 \'I\'m going to kill a man\'\n30 \'It\'s as if you were already dead\'\n\f62   CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nsequence, Charles and Helene\'s meal in the restaurant, the\ninvisible murder is in fact symbolically expressed by the cutting\nup of a succulent roast duck. (We learn later that Paul was dying\nhorribly from poisoning at this precise moment.) As Chabrol has\nwritten of Hitchcock, the subjective point of view is replaced by\nobjectivity at the crucial moment in the plot (Chabrol I976: I33-\n4). But by restoring Charles\'s perspective at the end of the film,\nChabrol allows Que la bete meure to end with a renewed (if quali·\nfied) identification between spectator and avenger, and with a\nrenewed (if qualified) depth of emotion. The righteous catharsis\nof the traditional revenge narrative is absent, but there is a sense\nof loss (instead of hatred) and of sacrifice (instead of triumph).\nThe means may be the same, but Charles\'s subjective narration\nnow expresses a much more poignant experience than the story\nhe set out to tell, \'the old story of hate, murder and revenge\'.\n\n\n\nLe Boucher\nWritten quickly by Chabrol, simply constructed with only two main\ncharacters, Le Boucher was the most popular film of the Helene\ncycle, and remains his most famous work to date. (The Parisian\nbox-office figures for Le Boucher (I969) show 2I9,000 spectators,\nas opposed to 204,000 for La Rupture, 203,000 for Que la bite meure,\nand less than 200,000 for the other films of the cycle (Braucourt\nI97I:I77). Le Boucher also did very well abroad, especially in the\nUnited States.) The film concerns the uneasy balance between two\nconflicting principles embodied by the two protagonists. On the\none hand there is culture, education, civilisation, represented in\nthe person of the schoolteacher, Mademoiselle Helene (Stephane\nAudran); and on the other nature, violence, sex and death, the\nhidden forces beneath the surface of society, personified by the\nbutcher, Popaul (Jean Yanne). Although apparently schematic, this\ndichotomy fluctuates and surprises throughout the film. Not only\nare Helene and Popaul in some ways as alike as they are opposite,\nbut the film maintains the tentative possibility of romance and\nmarriage between them - according to which one might see the\n\f                                            THE HELENE CYCLE        63\n\nschoolboy Charles as the potential couple\'s surrogate son - even\nafter Popaul\'s murders come to light. The plot centres on Helene\'s\ndiscovery (and ours) that Popaul is the serial killer operating in the\nvillage. The discovery is first made, then refuted, then confirmed\nagain, by means of the lighter given to Popaul by Helene. As Chabrol\nexplains, the lighter is \'the only dramatic element\' in the film, the\nmarker of Popaul\'s guilt and the catalyst for the simple narrative\npattern: \'(I) The lighter is offered. (2) The lighter is found on the\ncliff-top [i.e. the crime scene]. So, the conclusion: it\'s the said\nlighter. (3) No, it\'s not the one. (4) Yes it is. So, it\'s very easy. I\nadore symmetry\' (Yakir 1979: 4).\n    Like Le Beau Serge (1958), Le Boucher is set in a remote and\nenclosed French village (Sardent in the one, Tremolat in the other).\nThe first quarter of an hour or so of Le Boucher is a naturalistic\nrecord of a village wedding, at which Helene and Popaul are\nmerely two guests among many. What emerges from this long\nfirst sequence is the centrality of marriage to the continuity of\nvillage life, and the suggestion (when they dance together, and\nwhen he serves her the roast) that the butcher and the school-\nteacher may follow suit. But almost immediately there are hints\nthat things will not be that simple. Where the wedding sequence,\nand the theme of hope, continuity and community that it evokes,\nis introduced by the ringing of church bells, the second strand in\nthe narrative - the thriller element, the theme of the traumatic\npast, of war and murder - is introduced by a glimpse of the war\nmemorial and by the opening bars of Pierre Jansen\'s atonal score.\nAfter Helene and Popaul stroll together through the village and\nthen part, the camera remains fixed on the war memorial as the\ndiscordant music begins. Although the music lightens in tone and\nrises in pitch - in parallel with Helene\'s ascent to her flat above\nthe schoolroom - the sense of unease remains. Jansen\'s unsettling\nmusic returns throughout the film to underline the suspenseful\nor mysterious moments of the narrative - the arrival of the police,\nthe discovery of the murder victims, and so on. Once it seems\nclear that he is the killer, Popaul is associated with the war\nmemorial and the menacing music, in particular during the two\nnocturnal sequences when he approaches Helene\'s flat. (The\n\f64     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n symmetry underlying the film is upheld here. but with a typical\n twist: in the first of these sequences. Popaul is seemingly proven\n innocent; in the second. he confesses he is guilty.) The church\nbells. meanwhile. are also heard repeatedly. signalling the rites of\nlife and death (the wedding and the funeral) and structuring the\neveryday cycle of village existence (the time of day. the end of\nclasses on the hour). A contrast is established between Helene\n (order and continuity. the school. the church. the future of the\nvillage in the form of the children) and Popaul (the repressed\nviolence on which Helene\'s apparently tranquil order is based. the\ntraumas and wars of the past. which spill over in the form of his\nreminiscences about the army and atrocities in Indochina. and\nultimately in the form of the murders).\n    But in Le Boucher as in Que la bite meure the ostensibly simple.\nessentialist characterisation of the two leads is gradually broken\ndown. Like the \'beast\' played by Jean Yanne the previous year.\nPopaul may be a brute and a killer. but he is also a generous man\nwho loves life (and Chabrol\'s favourite symbol of life. food).\nHelene. although intelligent. graceful and cultured. is also pre-\nsented at times as a cold. diffident figure. who has physically\nretreated from life. first by leaving Paris for Tremolat. second by\nlocking herself in a tower high above the rest of the village. And to\na degree. the two protagonists are comparable. Both have traumas\nin the past: Popaul his army experiences. Helene a love affair ten\nyears previously which ended in a breakdown. Neither can express\ntheir affection for the other in direct terms: Popaul does so by\ngiving Heli~ne the leg oflamb and the cherries. Helene by giving\nPopaul the lighter at the same time as refusing his kiss. This\naction is paradoxical. and as such represents Helene\'s ambi-\nvalence towards Popaul, since the sexual connotations of the\nlighter - it lights his fire. and makes her \'une allumeuse\' J1 -\ncontradict the refusal of the kiss. (One might also compare the\nsize of the two lighters given as gifts in Le Boucher and La Femme\ninfidele: the flame of Helene\'s passion in the former is modest. in\nthe latter it is exaggeratedly large.) Most crucially. and in contrast\n31 \'a tease\'. The French word \'allumer\' means to light up (a cigarette), but also to\n   turn on (sexually).\n\f                                                    THE HELENE CYCLE           65\n\nwith La Femme infidele and Notorious, Helene cannot kiss Popaul\n (in effect speaking the \'saving word\' oflove) until it is too late. In\nfact, she is only able to do so when she knows that Popaul is dying.\nIt has been suggested in this context that Helene\'s sexual frigidity\nrecalls that of Hitchcock\'s Marnie (Braucourt 1971: 93). Certainly\nthere are allusions to Marnie (1964) in Le Boucher, notably\n Helene\'s need to bury the past by taking a new job (compare\nMarnie\'s interview at Rutland\'s, where she speaks of needing\n\'good, hard, demanding work\'), her black-out at a critical moment\n(compare Marnie\'s reaction to the colour red), and her conjuring\nup of Popaul at the schoolroom window (compare Marnie\'s dream\nabout the sailors tapping at the window because \'they want in\').\nBut Hitchcock follows the development ofa stereotypical, if warped,\nromance (red-blooded husband and frigid wife) to an implied\npoint of resolution and consummationY Chabrol, on the other\nhand, charts the tragic impossibility of such a romance. And as he\nhimself has pointed out, sexual obsession is limited to the\ncharacters in his films, whereas it is in fact shared by Hitchcock\n(Jousse and Toubiana 199T 27-8). Where Chabrol keeps Popaul\'s\nsexually motivated murders off-screen, Hitchcock cannot repress\nMark\'s implied sexual assault on Mamie: the subsequent scene,\nin which Mark rescues Mamie from a suicide attempt by drown-\ning, is shot exactly like a rape.\n    Although she is the object of Popaul\'s sexual obsession,\nHelene in turn attempts to reconfigure what she knows of him to\nfit her own romantic desires. This is the motive behind her denial\nof his guilt, and her shattering relief when she is able to believe\nhim innocent (the scene with the cherries and the lighter). The key\nto Helene\'s romantic fantasies is provided in the early dictation\nsequence, during which she reads her class the following passage\nfrom Balzac while Popaul appears, as if summoned by the text, at\nthe schoolroom window:\n   En entendant ouvrir la porte de la chambre avec brusquerie,\n   Helene s\'etait levee du divan sur lequel elle reposait, mais elle vit le\n32 Originally, the film was to have ended - rather like La Femme infidele - with a\n   love scene \'to be interrupted by the arrival of the police who came to arrest\n   Mamie\' (Truffaut 1984: 470).\n\f66     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n     marquis et jeta un cri de surprise.

None the less, in the\nrehearsal for the village fete, Helene tries to recast Popaul as the\narchetypal romantic hero, the marquis. Popaul, like the school\nchildren but unlike Helene, is dressed in period costume inclu-\nding hose and frilly cuffs. His costume presents an outward show\nof aristocratic refinement: ostensibly, he has become the marquis.\nBut as it progresses, the dance sequence reveals a gulf between the\ntwo protagonists\' fantasies of each other. Chabrol evokes Popaul\'s\ndesire in a long, slow, subjective zoom on Helene as the butcher\nwatches her in silence. When she turns and, addressing the\n\n33 \'On hearing the bedroom door open abruptly, Helime had risen from the divan\n   where she was resting, but she then saw the marquis and gave a cry of surprise.\n   She had changed so much that only a father\'s eyes would have recognised her.\n   The tropical sun had lent her pale face an attractive tanned complexion, a\n   marvellous colour, which gave her a poetic expression, and she radiated an air of\n   grandeur, a majestic firmness, a deep emotion, which would have impressed\n   the coarsest soul\'\n34 \'marvellous colour\'\n35 \'a father\'s eyes\'\n36 the coarsest soul\'\n\f                                                THE HELENE CYCLE         67\n\ncamera, asks Popaul to join the dance, the brooding tension eases\nand there is a glimpse of romantic possibilities. These are swiftly\n shattered by what follows. Popaul\'s costume seems increasingly\nincongruous as he stumbles clumsily next to Helene. The baroque\nmusic only heightens the absurdity and stresses how far he falls\nshort of the figure of romantic hero. In fact, Popaul is charac-\nterised as a schoolboy rather than a potential lover (a parallel\nunderlined here by the period costume and elsewhere by his habit\nof calling her \'Mademoiselle Helene\'). Helene appears unable to\nswap sexual threat (butcher) for romantic ideal (marquis). Instead,\nshe is here confronted with a seemingly desexualised and inept\nschoolboy (Popaul in costume), while elsewhere she will be\nconfronted with the tragic, dying man of the closing scenes (too\nlate), and the atavistic Cro-Magnon man (too threatening). Implicit\nfrom the opening credits onwards, this last parallel is emphasised\nin the central section. After the rehearsal, during which Popaul\ntells Helene \'j\'adore me deguiser\',J7 she informs her class, on a\ntrip to the prehistoric caves, that if Cro-Magnon man were alive\ntoday, \'Peut-Hre qu\'il se transformerait pour vivre parmi nous,\npeut-etre qu\'il mourrait\'.J8 There follows the grim proof that Popaul\nhas yet to achieve this transformation: the discovery of the second\nmurder victim on the cliff-top. As Helene unwittingly suggests, it\nis Popaul\'s inability to transform himself (to submit his desires to\ncivilised codes of behaviour) that will also result in his own death.\n    Ironically (and in keeping with the twisted symmetry of the\nfilm), it is in the schoolroom - the very place where she invoked\nthe image of the romantic hero - that Helene is finally confronted\nwith Popaul-as-murderer. But the threat he poses is deflected in\nthe suicide that follows. Crucially, Chabrol films Popaul from\nHelene\'s point of view here: when she shuts her eyes in response\nto his approach with the knife, the screen fades to black. Con-\nsequently, as in Que la bete meure, the critical action is not actually\nshown, leaving room for different interpretations. Most logically,\nPopaul has stabbed himself while the screen was black. But there\n\n37 \'I love dressing up\'\n38 \'Perhaps he would transfonn himself in order to live among us; perhaps he\n   would die\'\n\f68     CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nremains the suggestion that HelE~ne is, if not literally responsible,\nthen at least morally responsible for his death. Not only does she\nshut her eyes to his desperate confession, one may infer that she\nfantasises his suicide, thus ultimately transforming him from\nthreatening brute to subjugated romantic hero, and allowing her\nto accede to his dying demand for a kiss. Helene also shuts her\neyes in the hospital when the pulse of the red light ceases -\ninstants before she is told Popaul is dead. As Michael Walker has\nnoted, \'The whole section of the fIlm between the two moments\nwhen she closes her eyes has an extra dimension - as if it were\nalso, in some sense, her fantasy ...: an idealisation of "what might\nhave been\'" (Walker 1975: 51). As in Que la bete meure - which also\nends with an evocation of what might have been - the symmetry\nof the narrative heightens the poignancy of the impossible\nromance. When Helene kisses Popaul in the hospital, the spectre\nof that refused kiss in the woods returns, as does Popaul\'s hopeful\ncomment Taime bien vous regarder comme tya, avec les enfants\')9\nJust like Charles and Helene in Que la bite meure, Popaul and\nHelene could have loved each other (could even have had child-\nren) if they had not been carried away by more violent passions.\n    Chabrol defines accepted morality as \'Une regIe du jeu qui\narrange une classe dominante\', and as a means of hiding the fact\nthat \'11 n\'est point d\'ames toutes noires, ni toutes blanches\'4                     0\n\n\n(Chabrol 1976: 53). In this context, Helene is the good soul, the\nrepresentative of dominant ideology and morality, while Popaul is\nthe evil soul, a scapegoat for society\'s ills. He is the embodiment\n(via the psychological trauma of his war experiences, compulsively\nrepeated in his words and his actions) of the violence which\ncivilisation is built on but which it keeps repressed. As such, one\ncould say that Popaul - the proletarian war veteran - is destroyed\nby Helene as the official representative of the dominant class, the\nbourgeoisie. Le Boucher also bears comparison with both La\nFemme infidele and Juste avant la nuit - fIlms in which the status\n\n39 \') love to look at you like this - with children\'\n40 \'The rules of a game which suits the dominant class\'; \'No soul is completely evil,\n   nor completely good\'. Chabrol adds that the concept of moral relativism is the\n   single theme common to all his films.\n\f                                             THE HELENE CYCLE       69\n\nquo is preserved by the absorption or repression of violence\n(the suicide of Popaul, the murder of Victor, the half-murder, half-\nsuicide of Charles). But there is a difference here: the cost to Helene.\nAt the end of La Femme infidele and Juste avant la nuit, Helene is\nthe focal point for the continuation of family life. In the former\nshe is framed holding Michel, in the latter she is the centre of a\nfamily group (son, daughter, mother-in-law), with her dead\nhusband already forgotten. But at the end of Le Boucher, Helene is\nalone, faced with an uncertain future. Even if the village is now a\npurified community, from which the disruptive element, Popaul\n(like Victor in La Femme infidele or Laura and Charles in Juste avant\nla nuit) has been expelled, there remains the question of Helene\'s\nfuture place in it. Formally, Chabrol ends the film on another note\nof symmetry: \'Capri, petite ile\', the song from the wedding\nsequence, is heard over the final credits. But although the contin-\nuity of the village and its rituals is thus reiterated, Helene herself\nis more removed from the life of the community than ever before.\nAnd where the film began with a series of establishing shots of\nTremolat, each closer than the last, it ends with the reverse: a series\nof increasingly distant shots of the village in the morning mist, as\nif to evoke the distance that now separates Helene (and Popaul)\nfrom the society where they first seemed to belong.\n\n\n\nLa Rupture\nLa Rupture (1970) crystallises the melodramatic tendencies of the\nHelene cycle, and the inter-class tensions implicit in Les Biches\nand Le Boucher. On both counts, the film is unusually unequi-\nvocal. Chabrol\'s characteristic ambivalence is almost entirely\nabsent, except - as ever - in the final shot. La Rupture pits absolute\ngood against absolute evil, in the form of a custody battle between\na working-class mother and her rich, megalomaniac father-in-law.\nThe mise en scene, especially the expressionist use of colour,\nunderlines this simple characterisation: warm, earthy, proletarian\nreds for Helene (Stephane Audran), cold blue and sinister black\nfor Regnier (Michel Bouquet). It is above all the generic code of\n\f70    ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nthe melodrama which allows the expression of such extremes in\nLa Rupture: \'The good people stay good. The villain stays bad.... I\nwanted to make a melodrama, a real melodrama\' (Noguiera and\nZalaffi 1971: 5).\n     Melodrama and class are intimately related. But there are\nconflicting theories about the social origins of the genre. It has\nbeen linked with the proletarian entertainments of early cinema:\n\'Spectacle plebeien a l\'origine, le cinema s\'etait empare des\nthemes du feuilleton populaire et du melodrame Oll se retrouvent\n... hasards providentiels, magie du double (sosies, jumeaux), aven-\ntures extraordinaires, conflits oedipiens avec paratre, maratre,\norphelins, secret de la naissance, innocence persecutee\'41 (Morin\n1972: 22-3). According to others, however, \'the family whose\ndrama the melodrama enacts is ... the bourgeois family\', therefore\n\'The characters are neither the rulers nor the ruled, but occupy a\nmiddle ground, exercising local power, or suffering local power-\nlessness, within the family or the small town\' (Nowell-Smith 1977:\n70-1). The magical and menacing universe that Morin describes\ncertainly seems nearer the world of La Rupture than the (American)\nsmall town environment identified by Nowell·Smith. Hence the\npresence in Chabrol\'s film of doubles (Sonia as \'l\'autre Helene\'),4\'\nof Charles\'s Oedipal struggle with his cruel parents, of Helene as\nthe embodiment of persecuted innocence, and of a general air of\nmagic and mystery, incarnated not only by the three old women\n(the three fates) but also by the balloon-seller and by the ghostly\nhand of destiny that is glimpsed in the tram-ride sequence. 4J\nMoreover, La Rupture concerns precisely those social categories\nabsent in the bourgeois melodrama, \'the rulers\' (Regnier) and \'the\nruled\' (Helene). The only truly petit bourgeois characters are the\n\n\n41 \'Originallya working·class spectacle. the cinema had seized upon the themes of\n   the popular serial and the melodrama. which combined chance happenings. the\n   magic of the double (doppelgiingers. twins). extraordinary adventures, Oedipal\n   struggles with cruel father and mother figures, orphans. secrets of birth, and\n   persecuted innocence.\' For Chabrol\'s comments on melodramatic literature as\n   authentically proletarian and left-wing. see Chabrol 1976: 48.\n42 \'the other Helene\'\n43 A direct reference to Murnau\'s classic melodrama, Sunrise (1927).\n\f                                                    THE HELENE CYCLE           71\n\n\nPinellis, who run the guesthouse.+4 But the assertion that \'patri-\narchal right is of central importance\' (ibid.: 71) in the bourgeois\nmelodrama is pertinent here. In fact, throughout La Rupture we\nobserve patriarchal right in a literal battle with the matriarchal\nconcerns of what has been called the maternal melodrama. In\nother words, the custody battle within La Rupture literalises a\nnumber of melodramatic motifs, both bourgeois and proletarian:\nnot only good versus evil, but also mother versus father and more\ngenerally, the matriarchal (emotional warmth, the true family, the\ndomestic sphere) versus the patriarchal (Regnier as the arch\npatriarch, Michel as his future heir and thus a potential continu-\nation of his power). The central theme of the film, which holds all\nthese strands together, is possession, in both a material sense (the\ncustody battle, the Regnier inheritance) and also in a more occult\nsense (drugs, destiny, doubles).\n    For all the strident emotionalism, simple characterisation and\nmelodramatic themes, La Rupture is as precisely structured as the\nrest of the Helene cycle. It is by means of attention to narrative\nform and to mise en scene that Chabrol brings out the full impact of\nthe melodrama. As in early melodrama, doubling is a key theme.\nHere it is present at the level of the narrative (the opening and\npenultimate sequences both concern a domestic breakfast which\nends in an attack on Helene, first by Charles, then by Paul) and\nabove all in the characterisation. Sonia is not just disguised as\nHelene late in the film, but acts as her \'evil twin\' throughout. It is\nSonia (who looks like Helene even before wearing the wig) who\nenacts the illicit behaviour that Helene is falsely accused of:\ndishonesty, slovenliness, sexual obsession, and ultimately the\ncorruption of Elise with pornography and drugs. In a sense, Sonia\nis the sexualised (and hence demonised) side of Helene, who\nherself, as Paul admits, is as white as the driven snow. 45 (There is\nalso a doubling of characters from Chabrol\'s earlier films: when\n\n44 The guesthouse is reminiscent of the pension Vauquerin Balzac\'s Le Pere Coriot,\n   and certain echoes of Balzac\'s melodramatic novel can be found in La Rupture.\n45 Thus Helene is the \'white woman\' (desexualised mother) while Sonia is the \'red\n   woman\' (sexualised, threatening). For more on this traditional dichotomy in the\n   representation of women, see Theweleit 1987.\n\f72   CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nCharles throws his mother down the stairs, he is revealed as an\nadult version of the son in La Muette; Monsieur Pinelli, an alcoholic\nsince the birth of his mentally handicapped child, is an older\nversion of Serge in Le Beau Serge.) As in most of his fIlms, Chabrol\nuses mise en scene extremely effectively to externalise the charac-\nterisation. This is not just typical of Chabrol but also of melo-\ndrama, which relies on the \'externalisation of internal emotions\nand their embodiment within the mise en scene or decor\' (Doane\n1987: 72). In La Rupture, the emotions associated with the two lead\ncharacters are embodied by expressionist colour, as suggested\nabove. For Regnier this means black and blue, signifying evil and\ncoldness. His first appearance is notable in this respect: he enters\nthe (largely white) children\'s ward wearing a black coat and tall\nblack hat, thus resembling the archetypal villain of Victorian\nmelodrama. (If Sonia is Helene\'s evil twin, the thespian Gerard\nMostelle, dressed also in black and given to melodramatic delivery\nand gestures, is Regnier\'s good twin.) For Helene, it means warm,\nearthy reds and browns. Her son Michel is also associated with\nred, as is Charles during his convalescence, when he is clearly\ninfantilised, and is mothered by Helene (another example of the\ndoubling of characters within the fIlm).\n   The all-pervasive influence that Regnier exercises through his\nwealth is externalised in the shades of blue which seem to\nsurround Helene, particularly at crucial moments in the narrative.\n(Compare the use of blue to signify Why\'s descent into madness\nin Les Biches and to symbolise Philippe\'s oppressive and violent\npersonality in Une partie de plaisir.) On her arrival at the pension,\nfor instance, she is confronted by the cold and suspicious Madame\nPinelli (a weak and petty character who will be influenced by\nRegnier\'s financial offer later in the fIlm). While Helene is framed\non the right of the screen, dressed in reddish brown, with a similar-\ncoloured background behind her, Madame Pinelli is framed on\nthe left, dressed completely in blue, against a blue wall. Blue\nbegins to surround Helene from this point onwards: hence the\noverpowering decor of her room, the nocturnal scene where Paul\nmakes his last desperate attempt to kidnap her, and the shot of\nHelene standing alone outside Regnier\'s house, framed against a\n\f                                                      THE HELENE CYCLE             73\n\ndark-blue door. During the acid trip which threatens her sanity at\nthe close of the film, Helene maintains an awareness of the real\nthreat to her son by repeating to herself the importance of the\ncolour blue. This insistence on colour in La Rupture expresses the\napparently simple conflicts of melodrama and of class war: red\nversus blue, good versus evil, passion versus cunning, working\nclass versus upper class, and so on. It also underlines the meaning\nof the quotation from Racine at the start of the film: \'Mais queUe\nepaisse nuit tout a coup m\'environne?\':46 The night spoken of\nhere (and hinted at in the repeated shades of blue) is literalised\nwhen Helene is at her most vulnerable: night falls when she is\npenniless and stranded at the airport. To this literal and moral\ndarkness is added a spatial and temporal obscurity which isolates\nHelene even further. Alone and seemingly friendless, she is in an\nalien environment, a nameless town, sometime in the near\nfuture. 47 The melodrama\'s typical longing for the past (expressed\nin Helene\'s reminiscences on the tram) is thus complemented by\na desire for spatial escape (to Paris). Because this is melodrama, it\nis no surprise when Paul rather than Helene succumbs to evil,\nswallowed up by the black mirror at the end of the film. But\nbecause this is also Chabrol, once also feels that the struggle\nbetween Helene and Regnier (in its socio-political implications, at\nleast) goes on.\n\n\n\nJuste avant la nu;t\nThe final film of the Helene cycle, Juste avant la nuit (1971) was in\nfact only made as an emergency measure, and as such brilliantly\nillustrates Chabrol\'s pragmatism. Two weeks before shooting was\ndue to start on Ten Days\' Wonder, Orson Welles - playing the male\nlead - fell ill. The film was subsequently shot (with Welles but\n\n46 \'But what dark night suddenly surrounds me?\' - spoken by Oreste in\n    Andromaque.\n47 The mm is actually shot in Brussels. Hence HeUme\'s mantra about escaping to\n   Paris. Of the future setting, Chabrol has said: \'It portrays the world as it will be\n   in ten years time if .. : (Milne 1971: 9).\n\f74    CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nwithout the original female lead, Catherine Deneuve) in spring\n 1971. But in the meantime, and in order to avoid a massive loss by\ndisbanding the waiting film crew, the producer Andre Genoves\nasked Chabrol to shoot another film from scratch. Chabrol gave\nGenoves three novels he considered suitable for adaptation, and\n Edward Atlyah\'s The Thin Line was chosen. Chabrol modified the\nstory and then shot the film in seven weeks, in the winter of 1970-71.\n    Despite this far from ideal genesis, Juste avant la nuit provides a\npoignant inversion of the first film of the Helene cycle, and\nfunctions as a conclusion to the cycle as a whole. Chabrol\'s robust\ndefence of the film also serves to define its form: \'On m\'a reproche\nde me repeter, d\'avoir refait La Femme infidele. Je defie bien\nquiconque de mettre un gant droit a la main gauche\'48 (Chabrol\n1976: 175). Juste avant la nuit has essentially the same setting and\nplot as La Femme infidele: a bourgeois family living in Versailles\n(Stephane Audran as Helene, Michel Bouquet as Charles) and an\nextra-marital affair brought to an end by Charles\'s murder of the\nlover. And each has a Hitchcockian sub-plot to fill out the narra-\ntive (the disposal of Victor\'s body and the affair of the thieving\naccountant, both reminiscent of PSYChO).49 But Juste avant la nuit\ninverts the central premise of the earlier film. Thus where Charles\nDesvallees rescues his marriage by killing Victor and feeling no\nguilt, Charles Masson imperils his marriage not by having an\naffair with Laura or even by killing her, but by feeling guilty about\nit. His desperate quest for judgement from his wife and his best\nfriend (Frans:ois, Laura\'s husband), is met with a benign accept-\nance and a refusal to condemn (itself perhaps a parody of Chabrol\'s\nown moral creed). In a typically ambivalent ending, Charles is\nkilled by Helene (possibly to prevent him from giving himself up\nto the police), but only after he has hinted to her that he wants to\ndie. Consequently, where in La Femme infidele, once dead, Victor\nis abruptly forgotten by both Charles and Helene, in the final\nscene of Juste avant la nuit it is Charles himself who is quietly\n\n48 \') was criticised for repeating myself, for having remade La Femme infidele. )\n   defY anybody to put a right-handed glove on their left hand\'.\n49 The opening sequence of Psycho is, moreover, replicated at the start of juste\n   avant la nuit.\n\f                                                       THE HELENE CYCLE            75\n\nerased from family history, his own mother telling Helene \'les\nenfants commencent a oublier\'5 as they play happily on the beach.\n                                           0\n\n\n    Michel Bouquet has said that La Femme inftdele and Juste avant\nla nuit are \'deux films Oll Chabrol s\'interroge lui-meme\'5! (de\n Baecque 1997: 65). Bouquet\'s role as Charles Masson seems to\nrepresent Chabrol even more fully than his earlier performance as\nCharles Desvallees. Hence the physical resemblance (especially\nwhen wearing sunglasses early in the film), his \'hantise de devenir\nbourgeois\'52 and his desire to think of himself as an uncon-\nventional radical (he has written a novel, has a black au pair, wears\npaisley shirts, and above all, engages in a sadomasochistic affair\nwith his best friend\'s wife). This is in a sense a version of\nChabrol\'s own fascination with the controversial and provocative\nPaul Gegauff, a fascination played out in the realm of fiction by\nmeans of the collaboration with Gegauff on numerous screen-\nplays, and in particular via the creation of the Charles and Paul\ncharacters. Although Juste avant la nuit does not exorcise\nChabrol\'s fascination with Gegauff - that was to come three years\nlater, with Une partie de plaisir - it does present a Chabrolian\nfigure struggling with his Gegauffian fantasies. It is as if Charles\nwants to become a Paul, but then finds that he cannot maintain\nthis change of image in reality (only in play). A poster in the\nadvertising agency where he works declares that \'Toutes les\nfantaisies sont permises\' ,5l but this is only true as long as they\nremain fantasies. In his affair with Laura, and his lifestyle in\ngeneral, Charles has been playing at breaking certain (rather small)\ntaboos. But murder is a step too far. In reality, he cannot live with\nthe consequences of his role-playing actions. The theme of game-\nplaying is associated explicitly with the extra-marital affair (itself\nparodied by the chaste game of Scrabble that Charles plays at\nhome with Helene). Described by Charles as \'une sorte de theatre\ninsense\',5-I what we see of the affair is a game of dominance and\n\n50 \'the children are starting to forget\'\n51   \'two films where Chabrol asks questions about himself\n52   \'fear of becoming bourgeois\'. This is how Fran~ois describes Charles in the film.\n53   \'All fantasies are permitted\'\n54   \'a sort of insane play-acting\'\n\f76     CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n submission, with Laura asking Charles to punish, rape and kill\n her. The theatrical metaphor is reiterated by the mise en scene\n throughout the film, which features the repeated use of curtains,\n walls or doors to frame the action. This is most explicit when the\ncamera tracks forwards through open curtains to show Fran~ois\n being interviewed by the police in the flat where the murder (and\n the affair) took place. In the subsequent sequence, the same\ncamera movement (this time through an open doorway) reveals\nCharles and Helene playing Scrabble. The visual parallel between\nChabrol\'s filming of the illicit flat and the family home suggests a\nhidden similarity between them. The Massons\' house - designed\nby Fran~ois, who is an architect - although open-plan and made of\nglass, is none the less a place of secrets: hence Charles and\n Helene\'s bedroom (like Laura\'s flat) can be screened offby means\nof a curtain. When, at the close of the seemingly optimistic Christ-\nmas interlude, Helene is framed in the background, drawing the\nbedroom curtain (with Charles in the foreground, beside the\nChristmas tree), the implication is that the family secrets - the\naffair, the crime, and perhaps even marital sex, 55 - will be erased in\norder for the image of a happy family life to be preserved.\n    As with Les Biches, La Femme infidele and Le Boucher, a political\nreading of Juste avant la nuit would centre on the preservation of\nthe status quo by the expulsion (killing) of an unwanted element.\nThis applies to Laura\'s death, but also to Charles\'s (although the\nlatter is qualified by the suggestion that it might be aided suicide\nrather than murder). Both Laura and Charles threaten to stain the\ncontinuity of the blameless and conformist bourgeois family.\nHence the discourse of guilt and innocence, expressed in\nmetaphors of staining and cleaning, which dominates the film -\nas it dominates Betty (1992). In the very first scene, Laura wipes\nher kisses from Charles\'s face, telling him that no traces must be\nleft. After her death, when the handkerchief she used has indeed\nbecome incriminating, Charles throws it into a drain. His over-\npowering sense of guilt is parodied, and associated again with dirt,\n\n55 In contrast with the married couple of La Femme inftdtle, Charles and Helene in\n   Juste avant la nu it sleep in separate beds. This only heightens the contrast in the\n   film between partly-idealised family life and demonised, dangerous sexuality.\n\f                                                   THE HELENE CYCLE         77\n\nin the television advert for Culpa - a washing powder which, we\n are told, washes away evil. Ironically, it is because Helene and\n Frans;ois are fully prepared to whitewash his actions that Charles\ncannot be free from his burden of guilt, expressed by Chabrol in a\n number of compositions which place him behind bars, including\none superb dissolve which superimposes the bars of Frans;ois\'s\ngate onto a ghostly and despairing image of Charles. Ultimately\nconfessing his crime to Frans;ois, Charles declares that \'11 faut\nbien que je sois puni d\'une faS;on ou d\'une autre ... je ne peux pas\nsupporter de ne pas etre juge\' .56 The Christian implications of his\nsituation are challenged, however, by juxtaposition with the more\npragmatic but materialistic values of the bourgeoisie, represented\nby Helene and Frans;ois, according to whom Charles\'s guilt is a\nself-indulgent and dangerous obsession which threatens all of\nthem with scandal and tragedy. Not only is Laura\'s death\nmaterially useless, and dangerously dirty, but so too is Charles\'s\nguilt: hence the metaphor of the rat, which is linked with each in\nturn (Charles interrupts his son\'s story about the rat by revealing\nthat Laura was strangled; the rat is caught in the trap in the middle\nof one of Charles\'s confessions). In this context, Charles and\nLaura are simply vermin to be destroyed by the clean-living\nbourgeoisie. Their affair associates them with sex, role-play, death\nand religious obsession (Laura\'s Catholic medallion and Charles\'s\nsense of sin): all elements which, according to Georges Bataille,\nconventional society considers to be transgressive and undesirable\n\'corps etrangers\'57 (Bataille 1970: 58). Therefore there is a need to be\nrid of them, even if it means murder and the rewriting of family\nhistory. Mixing metaphors, one might say that in order to live in\nglass houses, the bourgeoisie must appear whiter than white.\n    This interpretation is complicated, as usual, by Chabrol\'s ambi-\nvalence. Two areas in particular are open to debate: the represen-\ntation of the bourgeois family and the question of Charles\'s death.\nWith regard to the first, for all the cynicism and self-preservation\npersonified by Helene, there remains a strong sense of family\nunity and of friendship in the film. This is epitomised in the\n56 \'I must be punished one way or another, I can\'t bear not being judged\'\n57 \'foreign bodies\', Italics in the original.\n\f78     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n Christmas celebrations (in which Fran<;:ois is included) and in the\n champagne toast that Helene and Charles\'s mother make to \'a\n happy family\'. As in the family compositions from La Femme\n infidele, these scenes are undercut by the irony of terrible secrets\n (Helene and Charles\'s affairs, Victor and Laura\'s deaths), but they\n are also to a certain extent representations of an ideal. It is in order\n to preserve this ideal (from which he is already absent during the\n champagne toast) that Charles has to die. When he makes his\n final confession on the beach, Helene turns away to see a woman\n pushing a child in a pram. This bleak image of a lone mother\n corresponds to the spectral image of Charles behind bars earlier in\n the film: both are virtual representations of what will happen to\nthe Masson family if Charles goes to the police. It is for this reason\nthat the film cannot end, as did La Femme infidele, with an opti-\nmistic arrest. Instead there is the pessimism of Charles\'s death,\nfollowed by the final image of the family group, without him, on\nthe wintry beach. This image recalls two films by Luis Bunuel -\n Un chien andalou (1928) and Belle de jour (1967). If the ending of\nthe former suggests that bourgeois marriage is like being buried\nin sand, Pierre and Severine\'s walk on the beach in the latter has a\nwintry pathos which is similar to the beach scenes in juste avant la\nnuit. Chabrol has in fact said that he and Bunuel have \'des rela-\ntions identiques aux deux corps sociaux que sont la bourgeoisie et\nle clerge\'58 (Guerin and Jousse 1995: 30). For both directors the\nchurch, like the bourgeois family, is a subject offascination and a\ntarget for satire. Returning to juste avant la nuit, the priest\'s prayer\nat Laura\'s funeral is punctuated by the roar of passing traffic, just\nas the peasants\' morning prayer in Bunuel\'s Viridiana (1961) is\npunctuated by the noise oflorries and cement-mixers.\n    As with La Femme infidele, in juste avant la nuit Chabrol miti-\ngates the apparent cynicism of the ending (it is as if Charles and\nVictor had never existed) by introducing the theme of mutual\nunderstanding between husband and wife. The long sequence in\njuste avant la nuit in which this understanding is reached plays on\nthe title of the film, so that Helene and Charles are in fact debating\n58 \'an identical position concerning the social institutions of the bourgeoisie and\n   the clergy\'\n\f                                                     THE HELENE CYCLE           79\n\nwho will be \'just\' before the coming of the night. When each has\nexplained their position (Charles needing a release from his guilt\nbut unable to confront suicide, Helene dismissing him as acting\n\'comme un fou\') ,59 a sudden and tacit pact seems to be reached (as\nit is with the burning of Victor\'s photo in La Femme infidele), and\nChabrol effects a circular tracking shot which physically encom-\npasses both protagonists\' point of view. Then Charles asks Helene\nfor something to make him sleep. She fills his glass with laudan-\num (something we have seen him do previously), but ensures that\nit is a fatal dose. At each gulp as he drinks the poison, she gives an\ninvoluntary start. Finally, they lie in their separate beds, holding\nhands (Charles in loud crimson, Helene in innocent white).\nCharles asks his wife \'Fais la nuit\',6o and the image fades to black.\nWhat makes this scene, and the entire film, particularly ironic and\nsad, is that the love Helene and Charles share has resulted quite\nsimply in his death, and his disappearance from even his children\'s\nmemory.\n     In the films of the Helene cycle Chabrol undertakes a question-\ning of bourgeois values within the apparently reassuring form of\nclassical realist cinema. There is ambivalence and disquiet here,\nbut it is beneath the surface (the surface is glossy and appears\nunproblematic). But what is perhaps most unsettling about the\ncycle is the evasion of closure in the endings. Will Why kill Paul in\nLes Biches? Does La Femme infidele end happily or not? In Que la\nbete meure, did Charles kill Paul and will he kill himself? Can\nHelene ever return to her place in the village community of Le\nBoucher? Does La Rupture signal the end of Helene\'s battle with\nRegnier? And in Juste avant la nuit, is Charles\'s death \'just\' or not?\nChabrol has said of his characteristically ambivalent endings that\nTarrHe toujours le film avant la scene finale. rai toujours prefere\nque la boucle de l\'histoire ne se ferme pas completement\'61\n(Bocquet 1997: 96). The ambivalence is all the more disquieting\n\n59 \'like a madman\'. Compare Charles\'s final statement to Helene in La Femme\n   infidele: \'le t\'aime comme un fou [I love you madly]\'.\n60 \'Make it dark\'\n61 \'I always stop the film before the final scene. I\'ve always preferred it when the\n   story does not come completely full circle\'\n\f80     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nsince Chabrol is operating within classical narrative cinema, and\nwithin the \'system\' (of representation, production and distribution).\nThis fact, and his use of popular genres (melodrama, thriller, even\nromance and vampire film) ensured that with the Helene cycle\nChabrol could reach (and subvert the assumptions of) a greater\naudience than his more experimental ex-new-wave colleagues. For\ninstance, while Godard\'s Tout va bim (1972), although intended to\nattract audiences of IOO,OOO via the appeal of Jane Fonda and\nYves Montand, was watched by only 30,000, Chabrol\'s Que la bite\nmeure, Le Boucher and La Rupture (none of which could boast a\nmajor star) each attracted over 200,000 spectators in Paris alone\n(Braucourt 1971: 177). After the disappointments of the I960s,\nwhen his films seemed to be either artistically successful (Les\nBonnes Femmes, L\'Oei! du malin) or commercially so (the Tigres, La\nLigne de demarcation), but never both at once, the Helene cycle\nbrilliantly fulfilled both of these criteria, so fundamental to\nChabrol\'s vision of cinema.\n\n\n\nReferences\nde Baecque, A.

The rituals of the bourgeois household, above all those\nof the dinner table, are the focus for his dissection of manners and\nmorals in A double tour (I959), La Muette (I965), La Femme infidele\n(I968) and Que la bite meure (I969). If the Helene cycle as a whole\ntends to balance satire with idealisation, La Muette presents a\nresolutely satirical picture of the bourgeois family. This short film\nstars Chabrol and his wife, Stephane Audran, as wealthy and ego-\ncentric parents who continually ignore their young son. (It is thus\na preparatory sketch for the family crisis in La Femme infidele.)\nChabrol and Audran overact with relish, exaggerating the grotes-\nque and self-obsessed nature of their characters. When the son\nreturns home from school, his mother appears to ask him a\nnumber of questions about his day, until we see that she is actually\nspeaking on the phone to a friend. The son is equally marginalised\nin the dinner scene, from which he seems at first to be absent (the\nfocus is on the father\'s unsavoury manners) until a slight shift of\nthe camera reveals him sitting silently at the table. The satire ends\nwith deliberate malice as the son, having been ignored for so long,\nstuffs his ears so that he won\'t have to listen to his parents any\nlonger; in the final scene, his mother falls down the stairs but he is\nunable to hear her dying cries and walks innocently out of the\nhouse.\n   As we saw in the last chapter, La Rupture (I970) is in several\nways a sequel to La Muette, not least in its entirely negative\n\f                                                 FAMILY PLOTS      83\n\nportrayal of the grande bourgeoisie, here represented by the\npowerful Regnier household with whom the \'uneducated\' and\n\'vulgar\' ex-stripper and barmaid Helene is engaged in a custody\nbattle which seems more like class war. It is however in a number\nof films made after the Helene cycle that Chabrol develops his\ndepiction of the bourgeois family. In particular, the I970S saw\nhim repeatedly address the role of fathers within the family.\nWhere the melodrama is traditionally associated with representa-\ntions of motherhood, and is used by Chabrol to address questions\nof maternity in La Rupture and again later in Une affaire de femmes\n(I988), the thriller - with its conventional emphasis on male figures\nof authority - is the generic vehicle for most of the explorations of\nfatherhood we are about to consider.\n\n\n\nTen Days\' Wonder\nTen Days\' Wonder (I97I) (also known as La Decade prodigieuse)\ninvokes that basic paradigm of family tensions and of mystery\nthrillers, the Oedipus myth. Although it features a Charles, a Paul\nand an Helene, it represents a break with the Helene cycle in\nseveral ways. Filmed in English, with two major American stars in\nOrson Welles and Anthony Perkins, it concentrates not on any\nrivalry between Paul and Charles for Helene, but on the nature of\npatriarchal authority, embodied by the omnipotent and tyrannical\npaterJamilias, Theo van Horn (Orson Welles). It is thus the first in\na series of films - including Les Noces rouges (I973), Une partie de\nplaisir (I975), Blood Relatives (I978) and Poulet au vinaigre (I985) -\nwhich explore paternal role models (usually to find them wanting).\nMoreover, in the character of Paul Regis - a detective in the Ellery\nQueen source novel, recast by Chabrol as a philosophy professor-\nTen Days\' Wonder introduces the prototype of the detective·as-\nsurrogate-father, a character who reappears in a less compromised\nform as Steve Carella in Blood Relatives, and as Jean Lavardin in\nPoulet au vinaigre and its film and television sequels.\n   Ten Days\' Wonder has been described as \'the screen\'s first theo-\nlogical thriller\' (Dawson I972: 227). It concerns the machinations\n\f84      CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n of the powerful and god-like Theo to destroy his son Charles\n (Perkins) in revenge for having an affair with Theo\'s wife, Helene.\nThe outsider in this neurotic household, Paul (Michel Piccoli), is\n just another pawn in Theo\'s plan - an intellectual called in to\nwitness Charles\'s erratic behaviour and the fascinating pattern of\nhis supposed crimes (Theo frames Charles so that it appears as if\nhe has broken each of the Ten Commandments in turn). The\nOedipal triangle in the HIm centres on father-son tensions rather\nthan mother-son incest (in fact, there is no incest as such, since\nHelene is Charles\'s step-mother). Theo is characterised as both\nZeus and the vengeful God of the Old Testament, while Charles\nbecomes alternatively Oedipus, Adam (naked in the garden with\nHelene as Eve) and Christ (abandoned by his father at the time of\nhis despair, and dying in a suicide which looks like a crucifIxion).\nFather-son relations in the mm are also articulated by reference\nto the work of Franz Kafka. Hence the stem, unforgiving father\nand the rebellious yet timid and deeply unhappy son. Georges\nBataille has observed that \'Kafka wanted to entitle his entire work\n"Attempts to escape the paternal sphere" ... What he really wanted\nwas to live within the paternal sphere - as an exile" (Bataille 1990:\n156-7). This expresses Charles\'s dilemma: striving to break free\nfrom the authoritarian father, yet also in awe of him, declaring\nthat \'He gave me all he had: A potential escape route is provided\nby Paul, a rational, atheistic surrogate father who was responsible\nin the past for breaking down Charles\'s faith and his fIXation with\nTheo (\'I took your God away\'). But although Charles and Paul are\nidentifIed with each other through dress, and later through the\none\'s confession to the other, Charles is unable - or unwilling - to\nescape the paternal sphere. He chooses to return to the paternal\nhome from the alienating freedom of Paris. And once there, it is\nironically Paul just as much as Theo who drives him to his death.\nThe Kafkaesque resonance ofTen Days\' Wonder, from the opening\nscene of Charles waking in the hotel room to the central father-\nson relationship, is enhanced by Chabrol\'s casting. The pairing of\nWelles and Perkins evokes Welles\'s 1962 mm of The Trial, in\n\nI    Italics in original.\n\f                                                FAMI L Y PLOTS    85\n\nwhich Perkins plays the victimised Joseph K., while Welles him-\nself is an omnipotent presence, both on and off-screen, in his role\nas the advocate (associated with \'the scriptures of the Law\' just as\nTheo is with the Old Testament) and as the film\'s auteur. Welles\'s\ninstantly recognisable voice closes The Trial - with the supreme\nauteurist statement \'I played the Advocate, and wrote and directed\nthis film: my name is Orson Welles\' - just as it introduces Ten\n Days\' Wonder.\n    The mise en scene of Ten Days\' Wonder is almost exaggeratedly\nbaroque, with ornate camera movements, luscious photography\nand opulent decor. The action tends to be bathed in blue light (the\nopening sequence in Paris, the exterior and nocturnal scenes in\nAlsace) or set in heavily stylised and predominantly blue interiors\n(the van Horn mansion; the hotels where the blackmail sub-plot\ndevelops). These characteristics recall the formal mise en scene of\nthe HelE~ne cycle generally, and specifically Chabrol\'s use of colour\nin La Rupture. Theo van Horn\'s all-pervasive patriarchal presence\nis expressed, even in his absence, by the ubiquitous colour blue, as\nis Regnier\'s in La Rupture and, later, Philippe\'s in Une partie de\nplaisir. Thus even when Charles van Horn is in Paris, miles from\nhis father, he - and indeed the entire city - is shadowed in blue\nlight, just as Helene staying in the guesthouse is still subject to\nRegnier\'s influence, symbolised by the overpowering blue decor\nof her room. (Moreover, the blue decor of the hotels in Ten Days\'\nWonder, as much as the enigmatic voice on the telephone, sug-\ngests that Theo is the unseen blackmailer.) In some ways an\nexaggeration of WelIes himself, Theo can also be seen as a hyper-\nbolic parody of Chabrol-as-auteur, indulging his omnipotence in\nthe manipulation of characters and the weaving of events into a\nformal pattern. In his later films on a paternal theme - notably\nBlood Relatives and Poulet au vinaigre - Chabrol uses the figure of\nthe detective as a kind of alter ego. But in Ten Days\' Wonder, Paul\nis far too compromised, both as a truth-seeking investigator and as\na surrogate father, to fulfil that role. Asked by Charles and Helene\nto listen to their confession but not to judge them, he cannot\nprevent himself from making a (disastrously wrong) judgement.\nSeduced by the formal pattern of the crimes he has witnessed,\n\f86      CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nPaul convinces Charles that he is guilty of Helene\'s murder and\nthus provokes his suicide. When, a year later, Paul realises his\nmistake, he has to accept responsibility for Helene and Charles\'s\ndeaths. Like Theo, he too has been \'sitting in judgement on [his]\npuppets below\'. Where in Poulet au vinaigre the detective will free\nhis surrogate son from guilt by absolving him of a murder he did\ncommit, in Ten Days\' Wonder the detective kills his surrogate son\nby condemning him for a murder he did not.\n\n\n\nLes Noces rouges\nAs we saw with regard to Juste avant la nuit (1971), Chabrol has\ncompared his own attitude to the bourgeoisie with that of the\nsurrealist film-maker Luis Bufiuel. In 1972, Chabrol\'s wife,\nStephane Audran, appeared in Bufiuel\'s Le Charme discret de la\nbourgeoisie, a satire about six well-heeled characters in search of a\ndinner party. Audran has said that after this film, she started\ntelling Chabrol how Bufiuel would have tackled a given scene: \'Je\ncomparais: "Tiens, Bufiuel aurait fait ci. Tiens, Bufiuel aurait fait\nc;:a\'\'\'\' (Grassin and Bernard 1991: 58). Whether as a result of his\nwife\'s prompting or not, when in 1973 Chabrol wrote and filmed\nLes Noces rouges (1973), he made it a satire on the bourgeoisie very\nmuch in the manner of Bufiuel. The film stars four of the cast of\nLe Charme discret de la bourgeoisie, and combines a thriller plot\nderived from a real-life case (the Bourganeuf murders) with the\nportrayal of a corrupt Gaullist mayor. The film\'s release was\ndelayed, on the pretext that it might prejudice the Bourganeuf\nmurder trial. But as Chabrol points out, as soon as the elections of\nApril 1973 had taken place, the film was mysteriously released\n(Chabrol 1976: 176). In fact, Les Noces rouges works most success-\nfully neither as a political comment nor as a realistic thriller, but\nas a satire on bourgeois adultery and as a hyperbolic version of Le\nCharme discret de la bourgeoisie.\n\n\n2. \'[used to compare: "Buiiuel would have done it like this. Buiiuel would have\n   done it like that. .. ·\n\f                                                           FAMI L Y PLOTS         87\n\n    In Buftuel\'s fllm, Stephane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel (Paul\nThomas from La Rupture) play Madame and Monsieur Senechal,\na couple caught between the codes of bourgeois behaviour and the\ndesires that lie underneath. Early in the film they ignore their\nnewly arrived guests and climb down a trellis in order to have sex\nin the garden. When they return, brushing grass from their clothes\nand hair, their guests have disappeared (to be replaced by a bishop\nseeking a job as a gardener). In a later scene, Madame Thevenot\n(Delphine Seyrig) and the Ambassador of Miranda (Fernando\nRey) engage in frantic foreplay under Monsieur Thevenot\'s nose.\nBoth of these sequences are echoed in exaggerated form by the\nfrenetic bourgeois adultery of Les Noces rouges. Saddled with undesir-\nable partners (an impotent husband and a sickly wife), Lucienne\n(Audran) and Pierre (Michel Piccoli, the corrupt government mini-\nster in Le Charme discret), embark on a passionate affair. Chabrol\nincreases the absurdity of this situation in several ways. Firstly,\nLucienne\'s husband Paul (daude Pieplu, the colonel from Le\nChanne discret) is the local mayor and also Pierre\'s boss. Hence the\ncomic scene in which, immediately after the lovers have sex in the\ndrawing-room of a chateau, Pierre has to sit next to Paul at a meeting\nwhile the mayor blames the desecration of the chateau on teenage\ntearaways. Moreover, Audran and Piccoli overact furiously in their\nlove scenes, while Chabrol tends to shoot their affair with suspense-\nful music and sudden tracking shots. The sex scenes are never\nprivate and are often outside, as in the consummation of the affair\nby the lakeside, when Lucienne and Pierre are forced to hide in the\nbushes while a boat approaches. Chabrol had hinted at the farcical\nnature of bourgeois adultery in La Muette, where he himself played\na pere de famille having an affair with the maid. At the time, he\nremarked that \'il y a tout le cote folie sexuelle de la bourgeoisie. Les\n"folies bourgeoises", on pense que c\'est de la rigolade, mais c\'est\nvrai!\'J (Braucourt I97I: II2). In the first half of Les Noces rouges,\nthese \'folies bourgeoises\' are more evident and more ridiculous\nthan anywhere else in Chabrol\'s work. 4\n3 \'there is the entire question ofthe bourgeoisie\'s mad sexual passion. You might\n  think that "bourgeois passion" is a just a joke, but it\'s true!\'\n4 Except perhaps f<)r the film of the same title. See below for an analysis of Folies\n  bourgeoises (1976).\n\f88    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n    After Pierre kills his wife and Paul finds out about Lucienne\'s\naffair, Les Noces rouges changes in tone. Farce is swapped for sus-\npense as the three central characters engage in a battle of wills.\nThe shifting power relations of the Helene cycle are again in\nevidence, as when Paul, to all intents and purposes an impotent\ncuckold, suddenly thanks Lucienne and Pierre for their \'discre-\ntion\' and uses his new-found knowledge of their affair to black-\nmail Pierre into backing a crooked land deal. Although Paul is\nultimately murdered as a result (in a fake car accident inspired -\nlike the Bourganeuf murders - by James Cain\'s The Postman Always\n Rings Twice), from this moment on he is no longer a figure offun.\nThe impression created by the earlier sequences (in which he\nbounds across the lawn like a buffoon, or snores loudly on the\ncouch) is qualified once it becomes clear how cleverly he has mani-\npulated those around him. But those earlier scenes (in particular\nthe shot of him snoring while his wife and daughter laugh at him)\nalso reveal the weakness of Paul\'s position within his own family.\n    Far from being the authoritative father figure that a Gaullist\nmayor should be, and that Theo van Horn epitomises in Ten Days\'\nWonder, Paul is the butt of the family. This is partly because\nHelene (Eliana de Santis) is only his step-daughter. But it is also\nbecause he represents a bourgeois pomposity that Lucienne and\nHelene have both largely escaped, thanks to their lower social\norigins. Their alliance against Paul is both a light-hearted version\nof Pierre and Lucienne\'s murderous plot against him and a\nreminder of the closeness that, for Chabrol, characterises a non-\nbourgeois family. When Lucienne and her daughter sit together\narm in arm on the couch to watch television, one is reminded of\nChabrol\'s great affection for \'real\' families: \'The bourgeois family\nis a farce, you realise? It doesn\'t exist. But a real family, that is\nsomething wonderful\' (Nogueira and Zalaffi 1970: 6).5 The \'real\'\nfamily is personified by Helene in La Rupture, and is also hinted at\nin the closing images of La Femme infidele and Juste avant la nuit.\nEach time, the focus is on the mother. Father figures, however, are\nmore problematic. At the end of La Femme infidele, Helene stands\nholding Michel while Charles is emotionally present but physically\n 5 Italics in original.\n\f                                               FAMILY PLOTS      89\n\nabsent, as expressed in the Vertigo shot. The Paul of Que la bite\nmeure terrorises his wife and son; even in his absence, the family\ngroup is frozen, awaiting his arrival with trepidation. And at the\nstart of La Rupture, Heli~ne must literally fight Charles to protect\nMichel. For the rest of the film, Charles is incapacitated and\nreplaced by his own father, the megalomaniac Regnier. In Les\nNoces rouges, Helene again embodies the true family, but here\nshe is the daughter not the mother (Eliana de Santis not\nStephane Audran). The father is again either absent (Helene\'s\nbiological father) or virtual (Paul, the step-father). If Pierre\nrepresents a potential second step-father after Paul\'s murder, it\nis HeIene who curtails this possibility by innocently bringing\nLucienne and Pierre\'s affair to the attention of the police. By\ninvoking the truthfulness of the \'real\' family (which has\ncharacterised her relationship with her mother up to this point),\nHelene destroys Lucienne and punishes her for lying about her\n\'folies bourgeoises\' with Pierre.\n\n\n\nNodo\nIn contrast with Ten Days\' Wonder and us Noces rouges, Chabrol\'s\nsubsequent film does not concern murderous bourgeois families.\nIndeed, Nada (1974) might be said to posit a radical alternative to\nthe family group: the terrorist cell. A group of left-wingers and\nanarchists, calling themselves Nada, kidnap the American ambas-\nsador in Paris. In the bloody police siege that follows, the\nambassador and all but two of the terrorists are killed. But before\nthe siege begins, an alternative family seems to be established at\nthe gang\'s hide-out in the countryside. Chabrol contrasts almost\nidyllic pastoral sequences (the tentative affair between Epaulard\nand Cash, images of rabbits and wheatfields) with the violent\nurban world that has been temporarily left behind: police\nbrutality, suicide, paranoia. The treatment of Epaulard and Cash\nalso contrasts with the absurd but murderous passion of Lucienne\nand Pierre in us Noces rouges. Here, the affair is tender and\npoignant; it is not even consummated. But apart from this brief\n\f90     CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n interlude, there is in fact no mutual understanding among the\n terrorists. From the beginning, they act from different motives\n (desperation at the everyday struggle of living, fatalistic despair,\n revolutionary anger, drunken self-hatred), and even before the\nkidnap, the intellectual of the group, Treuffais (Michel Duchaus-\nsoy) pulls out. The gradual fragmentation of the group, their\nbloody destruction one by one, and the persistent comparison\nChabrol establishes between their violent and confused actions\nand those of the police against whom they are fighting, all\nheighten the sense of nihilism implied by the title. Moreover, as\none might expect, Chabrol portrays the state security apparatus as\nboth farcical and chilling. If, in Buiiuel\'s Le Charme discret de la\nbourgeoisie, the cynical political manoeuvrings of the Ministre de\nl\'Interieur are comically elided (drowned out by the noise of\naeroplanes and typewriters), in Nada, Chabrol shows them at\nlength. Ultimately, Nada also shows the recuperation of terror by\nthe state, as predicted by Treuffais\'s manifesto assertion that \'le\nterrorisme gauchiste et le terrorisme etatique sont les deux\nmachoires du meme piege acons\'.6\n    Chabrol had already suggested in the Helene cycle that murder\ncannot shake the social status quo. In his own words, \'The state is\nthe master of he who destroys it, not its supporters. Another\nphrase which applies to Nada is: the state prefers its own destruc-\ntion, and the death of all, to the revolution\' (Yakir 1979: 9). By the\nend of the film, the French state has turned the murder of the\nAmerican ambassador and the very existence of the Nada group to\nits own political advantage. Indeed, as the Assistant Minister\nexplains, allowing the terrorists to kill the ambassador both alien-\nates potential left-wing support for Nada and allows the govern-\nment to replace the American with a more amenable candidate.\nThis picture of the state\'s power to assimilate and neutralise its\nenemies recalls the theories of Jean Baudrillard. In Le Miroir de la\nproduction, published the year that Nada was filmed, Baudrillard\ndescribes France (and capitalist society in general) as character-\nised by \'la logique de l\'appropriation, l\'impossibilite de la depense,\n\n 6 \'leftist terrorism and state terrorism are the twin jaws of the same trap\'\n\f                                                           FAMILY PLOTS          91\n\n\ndu don, de la perte, l\'inexorabilite de la loi de la valeur\'7 (Baudril-\nlard 1973: 125). In such a society, even death and terrorism are\nrecuperable, and only revolution is not. The revolution, however,\nnever happens: it is indefinitely deferred, as in Nada, where the\nkidnapping is merely the means to raise money for a potential\nuprising at some time in the future. And even if it were to take\nplace eventually, would not the new order be reminiscent of the\nold? As Chabrol has said of Les Biches, \'It\'s a revolution: the\nreplacement of one class by another - Why replaces Frederique,\nbut she does it by becoming Frederique\' (Yakir 1979: 9).8\n    Nada is not, however, quite as nihilistic as first appears.\nChabrol does not go as far as Bunuel in dismissing all ideologies\nas equally futile. In Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie, Florence\npoints out that the rallying sign for the feminist movement is \'un\nsigne idiot, comme tous les autres: fasciste, communiste, victoire,\net le Christ est notre maitre\'.9 Similarly, the acronyms of the\nfictional terrorist groups cited at the end of Bunuel\'s ca obscur\nobjet du desir (1977) are all equally ludicrous: POP, PRIC, GRIF,\nRUT, GAREJ, PAF and STIC. Chabrol, by contrast, does not laugh\nat the Nada group. Their principles are right, it is their terrorist\npractices which are wrong. This becomes clear when Diaz (Fabio\nTesti) , having escaped from the siege, tapes a message to the press\nreiterating Treuffais\'s manifesto and renouncing terrorism as a\nmistake, an action \'consumable\' by the state. Chabrol\'s mise en\nscene here is suggestive: Diaz wears white, not his usual nihilistic.\nblack, as he tapes his statement (see Milne 1974). In the finale that\nfollows, Diaz is confronted by the police chief Goemond (Michel\nAumont). The latter has taken a hostage of his own, Treuffais, and\nanticipates that Diaz will kill his former colleague in response to a\nrumour that Treuffais is a police informer. This eventuality would\nonly confirm Treuffais\'s pessimistic prediction with a brutal\n 7 \'the logic of appropriation, the impossibility of spending, of giving, of losing,\n   and the relentless nature of the law of value\'. Compare Chabrol on the political\n   films of Costa-Gavras: \'Tout est recupere [everything is recuperated]\' (Chabrol\n   1976: 319)\'\n 8 Italics in original.\n 9 \'an idiotic sign, like all the others: Fascist, Communist, Victory, and Christ is\n   our lord\'\n\f92      CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nirony: he himself would become the victim of violence at the\nhands of both the state and the terrorists. But Diaz\'s final act is to\nkill Goemond and save Treuffais, at the cost of his own life. The\npragmatism and solidarity celebrated in this ending seem to\nreflect Chabrol\'s own ideology of the time, as explained to La Revue\ndu cinema in December 1973: \'je me borne aaccepter des dogmes\npour des temps limites: par exemple, en ce moment, je me dis\nqu\'apres tout, le marxisme-Ieninisme n\'est pas plus con qu\'autre\nchose ... ! Donc, partons de celle-ci en ne se faisant aucune espece\nd\'illusion\'lo (Magny 1987: 124). Two decades later, after the fall of\nthe Berlin Wall and the supposed death of Marxism, Chabrol was\nto resume, playfully, this position with La Ceremonie (1995)."\n\n\n\nLes Innocents aux mains sales; Folies bourgeoises\nLes Innocents aux mains sales (1975) shares with us Noces rouges a\nplot derived from The Postman Always Rings Twice, elements of\nfarce, a concern with sexual power and impotence, and actors\nfresh from working with Bunuel. Here, the latter play minor\ncharacters: both Franc;:ois Maistre (the detective Damy) and Jean\nRochefort (the aptly named lawyer, Albert Legal) had appeared the\nyear before in Bunuel\'s Le Fantome de la liberte (1974). Their droll\ncommentaries and eccentricities lend Chabrol\'s film a farcical\nedge, which is particularly strong in the pairing of Maistre and\nPierre Santini as two comic detectives. Moreover, the phone\nconversation gag at the end of the film is taken directly from Le\nCharme discret de la bourgeoisie, where again it features Maistre as\nan incredulous policeman. But the comedy in Les Innocents aux\nmains sales remains peripheral to the central plot, a convoluted\nand blackly ironic story of adultery and murder. For all its comedy\nturns, Les Innocents aux mains sales is also afilm noir.\n\n10   " limit myself to accepting a dogma for a certain length of time only: for\n     example, at the moment, I tell myself that a Marxist-Leninist position is, after\n     an, no more stupid than any other! So, let\'s start from that position, without\n     having any illusions about it\'\n11   See Chapter 7.\n\f                                                        FAMILY PLOTS       93\n\n     Although it can be defined, historically speaking, as a film\n movement limited to Hollywood in the 1940s,film noir has proved\n extremely influential on subsequent generations of film-makers,\n including those of the French new wave. The main legacy offilm\n noir is found in certain character types - the vulnerable and con-\n fused private eye, the seductive but dangerous femme fatale - and\n in the use of expressionism -looming shadows, unsettling camera\n angles - to evoke a chaotic and amoral universe. Film noir \'founds\n itself upon the absence of the family\', and presents \'family\n relations as broken, perverted, peripheral or impossible\' (Harvey\n 1980: 25). It is peopled by impotent or crippled husbands and\n childless couples (ibid.: 29, 33). In short, the family in film noir is a\n sterile and sick place. For wanting to escape this claustrophobic,\n desexualised family space and to fulfill her own ambitions (be they\n sexual or economic), the strong woman (the femme fatale) is\n usually condemned to imprisonment, suffering or death. Even\n this brief account offilm noir conventions suggests how closely Les\n Innocents aux mains sales follows the model. In fact, Chabrol\'s film\n could be described as an exaggerated version of film noir - or\n rather, a hybrid of film noir and farce, in which each genre com-\n petes with the other. The film centres on a childless couple - a\n rarity in Chabrol\'s work - made up of an alcoholic and impotent\nhusband, Louis (Rod Steiger), and his beautiful, unsatisfied wife\n Julie (Romy Schneider). From the start, the emphasis is on Louis\'s\npowerlessness and Julie\'s sexual power. When a handsome young\n stranger, Jeff, enters their lives, Julie fulfils her potential asfemme\nfatale and decides to murder her husband. (She is filmed in a\ntypical expressionist composition at one point, with the shadows\nof trees looming around her, signalling duplicity and menace.)"\nAfter a series of convoluted plot twists, Louis dies, Jeff is arrested\nand Julie is punished for her transgression. As the genre\ndemands, Chabrol\'s film \'damns the sexual woman and all who\nbecome enmeshed by her\' (Place 1980: 36).\n    As the film develops, so too does Julie\'s suffering: Louis\'s\napparent death is followed by JeWs disappearance. Julie finds her-\nself confronted by a series of men (Legal, the detectives, Georges)\n12 This image is in fact taken from Clouzofsjilm noir Le Corbeau (1943).\n\f94    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nintent on mocking her grief for her husband\'s death, and on\ntesting its sincerity. The final test is provided by Louis himself,\nmiraculously back from the dead. In one of Chabrol\'s blackest\nironies, no sooner has Julie passed this test - reversing her earlier\nchoice of Jeff over Louis, and choosing to stand by the husband\nshe had attempted to murder - than she is denied her second\nchance by Louis\'s second death. (A real death from a real heart\nattack, rather than the fake death and the fake heart trouble that\nLouis had simulated at the start of the mm.) The mm concludes\nwith Julie grieving, friendless and alone. Her husband\'s wealth is\nnow hers, but it has become meaningless. And in an echo of\nCain\'s The Postman Always Rings Twice, having originally been found\ninnocent of her genuine attempt to murder Louis, she is now\nimplicated in his accidental death. The final sequence formally\nmarks a return to the beginning. Les Innocents aux mains sales\nbegan with a left-to-right tracking shot across the coastal land-\nscape to Julie and Louis\'s villa, the camera movement expressing\nJeWs invasion of the couple\'s crumbling private space. Chabrol\nbegins the final scene with an identical camera movement but this\ntime at night, tracking from the distant lamp of the lighthouse to\nthe silent villa. Is the lighthouse calling to Julie somehow, or is she\nhearing the voice of her dead husband? Her face illuminated and\nlivid against a black background, she rises from the couch, and\nwith a kind of traumatised composure walks into the night\ntowards the flashing white light of the lighthouse. The camera\ntracks forwards into darkness and the light is flXed in a freeze-\nframe as the credits begin. In this hallucinatory moment, Julie\nand Louis have become comparable with the tragically separated\ncouples at the end of La Femme infidele, Le Boucher, and Folies bour-\ngeoises, and are in stark contrast with the adulterers so absurdly\nand literally shackled to each other in the final shot of Les Noces\nrouges. But Julie\'s isolation and imprisonment here remains a\npunishment, an excessive version of the typical film noir ending in\nwhich thefommefatale \'must be confined\' (ibid.: 46). Itis excessive\nand poignantly ironic because Julie - unlike, say, the fomme fatale\nin Mildred Pierce (1945) - has no husband to return to, yet wishes\nshe had.\n\f                                                     FAMILY PLOTS   95\n\n    like Les Noces rouges, and many of Chabrol\'s films since Les\nBiches in 1967, Les Innocents aux mains sales explores the changing\npower relations within a triangle of characters. A new edge is\nprovided not only by the exceptional number of twists in the plot,\nbut also by the erotic charge of the film. us Innocents aux mains\nsales is about sexual power, and conveys this with as much\neroticism as anything in Chabrol, whose habitually reserved\nrepresentation of sex has been commented on by critics (Wood\nand Walker 1970: 104). Although sexual power at first resides with\nthe femme fatale, it is later transferred to her once-impotent\nhusband. The key to the depiction of desire in the film is scopo-\nphilia, the power of the gaze. Hence where Paul, the cuckolded\nand impotent husband in Les Noces rouges, regains his control over\nhis wife and her lover by means of political blackmail, in Les\nInnocents aux mains sales Louis does so simply by spying on them.\nAnd although both men end up dead, Paul dies without ever\nhaving regained his sexual potency, while Louis achieves a com-\nplete sexual rebirth through voyeurism. As he tells Julie on his\nreturn from the grave, Jeff and Julie\'s plan to murder him has in\nfact only resulted in his rejuvenation: \'grace avous je suis vivant.\nEt j\'aime la vie."} Cured of his impotence, he proceeds to institute\n\'des relations nouvelles"4 in their marriage and, for all his cyni-\ncism and cruelty (he pays Julie to have sex with him), he thereby\ncements a new bond of sexual and emotional depth between\nhusband and wife. The real mystery in the film is ultimately not\nthe startling reappearance of first Louis and then Jeff when each\nwas supposed dead, but the restoration of Louis\'s sexual power\nthrough the act oflooking.\n   The theme of sexual predation and Julie\'s status as the object of\nmale desire is expressed in the first scene, where JeWs kite (a red\nbird of prey) lands suggestively on her as she lies sunbathing\nnaked. This is followed by Jerrs visit to the couple\'s home in the\nevening. Both of these scenes end with a close-up ofJulie\'s naked\nback as the opening credits roll. Finally, the third and crucial part\nof the credit sequence sees a brief and, it is later revealed,\n]3 \'thanks to you two. I\'m alive. And I love life\'\n]4 \'a new relationship\'\n\f96    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n deliberately exaggerated exposition of Louis\'s impotence and\nalcoholism in front of Jeff. Once Louis has staggered upstairs to\n bed, Jeff and Julie have sex on the rug, during which Chabrol\'s\nsignature (\'Un film de Claude Chabrol\')\'5 is superimposed on a\nfacial close-up of the two lovers. What makes this last scene so\nimportant to the plot of the film and indeed to an appreciation of\nChabrol\'s film-making technique in general. is the nature of the\ncamera shot used. As Julie walks on to the rug and lies down on it,\npulling her dress up over her thighs, Chabrol shoots from a high\nangle not used before in the film. Moreover, he zooms in on\nJulie\'s face as Jeff climbs on top of her and they begin to have sex.\nBoth the intensity of the zoom (suggesting heightened emotion of\nsome kind) and the precise angle of the shot (seemingly filmed\nfrom the top of the staircase) may appear just a little curious, but\nnone the less the impression remains that the scene is still being\nshot objectively, from the point of view of the camera rather than\nthat of a particular character. But what appears as objective\ncamera here is later revealed as subjective (just as Steiger\'s slightly\nhammy performance in the first sequence is later revealed as an\nact intended to test his wife). On his reappearance towards the end\nof the film, Louis tells Julie that he suspected her and Jeff\'s\nintentions from the beginning, and that he watched them make\nlove from the top of the stairs. This is the cue for a flashback of the\nsex scene, again seem from the high angle which is now identified\nas Louis\'s point of view. As Louis explains the ruse by which he\nescaped murder and apparently killed Jeff himself, the camera\ncircles round the staircase, now the site of power in the film. It was\nhere tha t Louis turned from a drunken victim to a cunning voyeur,\nand it is also from a superior position on the stairs that he reveals\nthe truth to Julie, who stands below him. He explains that his\nsexual impotence was cured by this act of voyeurism, and then\nrequires Julie to have sex with him in the very same place, on the\nrug. In a prediction of the closing sequence, the femme fatale has\nbeen \'confined\', put back in her place.\n    Ies Innocents aux mains sales was the last of Chabrol\'s films to\nbe produced by Andre Genoves, whose company Les Films La\n15 \'A film by Claude Chabrol\'\n\f                                                           FAMILY PLOTS         97\n\n Boetie had helped to finance all of Chabrol\'s work between 1967\nand 1975. It might therefore be said to bring to a close a particular\nchapter in his career, one which, most critics agree, stands as his\nmost consistently successful period. This sense of closure is\nheightened by Folies bourgeoises (1976), a little-known and little-\nliked film which in fact parodies the thematic and formal con-\ncerns of the Genoves years. More precisely, Folies bourgeoises is an\noutlandish parody of Les Innocents aux mains sales and Les Noces\nrouges: hence the plot centres on a love triangle and an impotent\nhusband. The eroticism and the hallucinatory final vision of Les\nInnocents aux mains sales are here exaggerated to the point of the\ngrotesque in several fantasy sequences, particularly one set at the\nCrazy Horse strip club, where William (Bruce Dern) finally\nachieves an erection only to imagine his wife Claire (Stephane\nAudran) cutting him down to size with a pair of scissors. As Bruce\nDern remarks of the soup he is served immediately after one such\nsequence, \'it\'s a bit overdone\'. None the less, and again as in Les\nInnocents aux mains sales among other films of the Genoves\nperiod, Chabrol achieves a dramatic shift in tone in the closing\nscenes, from hysterical (though largely unfunny) farce to a remark-\nable poignancy. Such mixing of registers has been described by\nChabrol as something foreign to French cinema: \'11 n\'y a qu\'en\nFrance qu\'on ne melange pas les tons. On n\'y a pas le droit de\ndemarrer drole et de terminer tragique ou vice-versa. <;a vient\nd\'une notion de gout\'. He continues: Taime bien ce que font les\nItaliens (comme Germi, Risi, Sake, Ferreri, Festa-Campanile),\nc\'est tres fort. Je crois que fen serais capable de faire l\'equivalent\nfran~ais, si c\'etait possible en France\',6 (Braucourt 1971: 119). It is\nfair to say that Folies bourgeoises is as close as Chabrol has come to\nthis ideal of a supposedly tasteless cinema of the sublime and the\ngrotesque. The film is also the last in his long line of Italian co-\nproductions, which includes twenty films from the 1960s and\n\n16 \'It\'s only in France that one doesn\'t mix different tones. Here, you don\'t have\n   the right to start off funny and end up tragic or vice versa. This comes from a\n   notion of taste ... I really like what the Italians do (like Germi, Risi, Sake,\n   Ferreri, and Festa-Campanile), it\'s very strong. I think I\'d be capable of making\n   the French equivalent if it were possible in France.\'\n\f98    ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n1970s. But in the final analysis, Folies bourgeoises is more than a\nself-parody or an exercise in bad taste. It is also the study of a\nmarried couple wavering frantically on the brink of separation.\nSuspicious, neurotic and unfaithful, Claire and William finally\nmanage to reach out to each other, with very little hope of making\ncontact. The film ends with one ofChabrol\'s most moving scenes\n(and one he would rework a decade later in Poulet au vinaigre) , as\nthe camera circles round two statues in a wintry garden, forever\nreaching out to each other but never touching. Thus Folies\nbourgeoises marks not only the end of the Genoves years but also\nthe end of Chabrol and Audran\'s marriage.\n\n\n\nBlood Relatives\nThe generic police thriller Blood Relatives (1978) (also known as Les\nLiens du sang) was shot in Montreal. in English, during the summer\nof 1977, at a time when Chabrol was also preparing his major\nproject Violette Noziere (1978). Both films introduce the question\nof incest into the apparent security of the petit bourgeois family,\nand they do so by emphasising the spatial constriction of the\nfamily home. If Muriel in Blood Relatives and Violette in Violette\n Noziere become entangled in incestuous relationships (the former\nwith her cousin Andrew, the latter implicitly with her father), the\nsuffocating closeness of the family home seems to be the cause.\nAs Chabrol has noted, the family unit is a source of great physical\ntension: \'What\'s frightening is that there\'s a father, a mother, and\nchildren - they are all pressed together - it\'s disgusting.... I don\'t\nsee how people can live that way - and yet it has such strength. It\'s\nmasochistic; they\'re unhappy but it endures\' (Yakir 1979: 8).\nConfronting their own teenage desires, Muriel and Violette\nattempt to negotiate a private, sexualised space away from their\nunhappy families. In Blood Relatives, Muriellives with her uncle\nand aunt, the Lowerys, and has to share a bedroom with her\ncousin Patricia; Muriel and her male cousin Andrew consummate\ntheir affair in a boat offshore from the rest of the family; her desire\nto escape the family is evoked in a slow, desperate tracking shot\n\f                                                              FAMILY PLOTS   99\n\naway from the meal table and down a corridor while her voice-over\ntells us \'I hate this house\'. She later plans to move into a hotel or\neven an apartment with her boss (himself just another surrogate\nto replace her dead father and her guardian-uncle). Blood ties\nensure that she never leaves the family space: she is murdered by\nPatricia before she can escape. In Violette Noziere, the projected\nescape is put into practice, with Violette leaving behind the\ncramped flat she shares with her parents to indulge in sexual\nadventures in nocturnal Paris. And, of course, Violette is not the\nvictim of murder but its perpetrator; she kills her father and\ndisables her mother. [7 But in Blood Relatives, each daughter figure\n(of whom Muriel is only one among four) remains subject to the\nmoral and physical hold of one or more father figures, who offer\nvarious personifications of patriarchal authority.\n    The father may be absent from La Rupture and Les Noces rouges\n(as the mother is from Les Cousins and Que la bete meure), but in\nBlood Relatives he proliferates into a number of characters. The\nalternative father-daughter relationships presented in the film\nvary from the obsessively patriarchal to the paedophiliac. That\neach is in fact a reflection of the others is apparent from the basic\nsimilarities in each case: these actual and virtual fathers are all in\ntheir forties, and the girls all teenagers. Chabrol thus suggests a\nnumber of possible models of paternal behaviour. Ironically, the\nmost satisfactory of these relationships is that between the detec-\ntive and the killer. Firstly, as a yardstick for comparison, there is\nthe conventional relationship between detective Steve Carella (Donald\nSutherland) and his daughter Helen, aged twelve. Although\nHelen remains in the background throughout the film, largely\nsupplanted by Patricia as an object of Carella\'s interest and even\naffection, the single scene between her and her father is crucial.\nChabrol shoots the two of them strolling arm in arm across a park\nin Montreal. As they approach the camera, Helen says, \'I like it\nwhen 1 hold you like this ... Dad, we\'re like lovers\'. Carella\'s\nresponse is gently to correct her misapprehension and to\nmaintain that their relationship is a safe, asexual, familial one: \'Ah\nno, we have something else.\' His correction is important: Helen\'s\n17 For further analysis of Violelte Noziere, see Chapter 6.\n\f100    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nreading of things finds its logical extension in the liaison between\nthe paedophile Doniac and his thirteen-year-old lover Jean- As for\nincest. that too will be portrayed in the film. although in the much\nmore ambiguous light of sex between cousins. But the \'something\nelse\' that Carella and Helen share will be replaced by the shifting\ngame of trust and confidence played between cop and witness-\nsuspect. in which fifteen-year-old Patricia becomes Carella\'s sur-\nrogate daughter.\n    Chabrol added the character of Helen to the Ed McBain source\nnovel. no doubt to allow the identification between the detective\'s\ntwo daughters (one real. one virtual). an identification which he\nhimself underlines when describing the subject of the film as \'the\nrelationship of a 4o-year old cop with his daughter ...• but it\'s not\neven his daughter\' (ibid.: 7). This process is confirmed when\nChabrol shoots Carella and Patricia walking arm in arm across the\nmeadow. exactly as Carella and Helen had crossed the park earlier.\nThere are two other scenes in which Chabrol\'s mise en scene associ-\nates Carella with Patricia. In his first appearance. the detective is\nframed in the archway where the murder took place; Muriellies\ndead where she stood in the pre-credit sequence. while Carella\nstands in Patricia\'s position - on the right and shot in profile.\nLater. at the identity parade. Patricia identifies the man she is\nlooking for (in fact a fantasy since she herself was the killer) as \'the\nsecond man from the left\': Chabrol\'s shot of the two-way mirror\nshows Carella\'s reflection as occupying that position. But for all\nthe growing rapport between Carella and Patricia (a rapport which\nis ironically fuelled by his suspicions and her lies). the composi-\ntion of their final meeting identifies the detective with Muriel and\nagainst her killer. By now. Carella has read Muriel\'s diary. and has\ncome to understand that Patricia committed the murder. In\nanother side-on shot which echoes the murder scene. Chabrol\nshows Carella crouching on the left of the frame opposite Patricia.\nwho is again on the right. His assumption of Muriel as a second\nsurrogate daughter is thus not only moral (his investigation into\nher death and his reading of her words) but also spatial (he\nassumes her position vis-a-vis Patricia). It is at this point that the\nkaleidoscope of family ties in the film is finally pulled into focus\n\f                                                FAMI L Y PLOTS    101\n\n\nand that Carella, correcting his paternal relationship with Patricia,\nsolves the murder.\n    If the paedophile Doniac represents one pole of paternal\nbehaviour with regard to daughters and sex, Lowery represents the\nother. (Muriel\'s boss Armstrong is an unsettling figure who\ncombines elements of each; while projecting the image of a\nconventional family man, he uses his authority over her to suggest\nthat they begin an affair.) As Muriel\'s uncle and Patricia\'s father,\nLowery is the family patriarch, a God-fearing Christian who\nproudly tells Carella that \'family\'s a sacred thing\' and that he\nvetted each of Muriel\'s boyfriends by inviting them into the house\nand asking them to shake his hand and look him in the eye. But\nthe very household that he ruled in this way is the seat not just of\nadolescent desires but of incestuous ones too. Although Muriel\nand Andrew are cousins, they are referred to as brother and sister\non several occasions, by the Lowerys and Patricia. The incest taboo\nwhich they themselves feel (Muriel tells Andrew \'It wouldn\'t be\nright for us to have a baby - we\'re blood relatives\') is hence all the\nstronger. And it is Patricia\'s repugnance at the sight and sound of\ntheir sexual acts that prompts her to kill Muriel and then incrim-\ninate Andrew. Her imaginary account of the murder simply\nrecasts the violent oral sex scene she witnessed as a killing: \'They\nwere cousins - almost like brother and sister - and he was forcing\nher to do this!\'. In a sense, by punishing Muriel for breaking the\nfamily taboo on sex between blood relatives, Patricia is merely the\ninstrument of her father\'s will. Her last words in the film reaffirm\nthe hierarchical importance of family ties even as they imply an\nincestuous desire of her own: \'He\'s got to love his sister more than\nhis cousin.\'\n    The theme of repetition which characterises Chabrol\'s repre-\nsentation of fatherhood in Blood Relatives is echoed in the narra-\ntive structure. The film is framed by the Hitchcockian device of\nthe lying flashback, made famous in Stage Fright (1950). As\nChabrol\'s account of that film points out, however, \'lying flash-\nback\' is in fact a misnomer. It is not the flashback images of the\nmurder that mislead the spectator, but the voice-over applied to\nthem: \'In Hitchcock films, the images never lie, though the\n\f102    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\ncharacters do. The same sequence shown without the soundtrack\ncan illustrate the true version of events. It is the commentary that\nmakes it false, that lies\' (Rohmer and Chabrol 1957= 105). Chabrol\nhimself is equally scrupulous not to cheat the spectator in Blood\nRelatives (and also in the flashback regarding Jeff\'s supposed\nmurder in Les Innocents aux mains sales). Muriel\'s murder is shown\nin part during the pre-credit sequence. It is then retold (falsely)\ntwice by Patricia, without any flashback images. Finally the\nmurder is shown in flashback, without any voice-over, but as a\nvisual representation of Patricia\'s confession to Carella at the\nfarm. Even here, in the true version, the theatricality of the gestures,\nenhanced by slow motion, renders the murder as unreal as ever.\n   The murder scenes which frame the film, the family plot, the\nnarrative repetition, the flat mise en scene and the kitsch decor all\ncombine to create an impression of claustrophobia in Blood\nRelatives. But Chabrol provides a glimpse of other possibilities in\nthe character of Carella. In contrast with the bad fathers of this\nfilm and others - La Rupture, Ten Days\' Wonder, Les Noces rouges,\nUne partie de plaisir - Carella is some kind of role model. Unlike\nCharles in Que la bite meure, who only appears to be a virtuous\nfather, but is in reality \'full of shadows\', Carella is \'a virtuous man\'\n(Yakir 1979: 12, 5). As Chabrol has suggested, it is in his ability \'to\njust let things be\' rather than to judge that Carella\'s virtue is most\napparent (ibid.: 5). Hence, despite his initial revulsion, Carella is\nactually quite lenient with Doniac, and refuses to pass comment\non Armstrong or Lowery. Coupling a professional regard for the\ntruth with a refusal to judge (unlike the Paul ofTen Days\' Wonder),\nCarella seems to reflect not only a Chabrolian ideal of fatherhood\nbut also a projection of the film-maker himself. This is even more\nexplicitly the case with Carella\'s 1980s avatar, Inspecteur Lavardin,\nsurrogate father, detective, and Chabrolian alter ego.\n\n\n\nPoulet au vinaigre; Inspecteur Lavardin\nIn a sense, the laconic Inspecteur Lavardin came to Chabrol\'s\nrescue in the mid-1980s. The first Lavardin film, Poulet au vinaigre\n\f                                                FAMILY PLOTS      103\n\n\n(1985), came at a low point in the director\'s career, after a number\nof poorly received projects including Le Cheval d\'orgueil (1980) and\n Le Sang des autres (1984). The eventual producer of Poulet au\nvinaigre, Marin Karmitz, tells how Chabrol had failed to find\nanyone to finance the film. Karmitz agreed to do so, as long as the\nbudget was cut from the French average of the time - twelve\nmillion francs - to six. The result was the relaunching of Chabrol\'s\ncareer, with Karmitz marketing Poulet au vinaigre as the director\'s\n\'second first film\', much as he had Godard\'s Sauve qui peut (la vie)\nsix years earlier (Jousse and Toubiana 1997: 73). Although it\nwould be more accurate to describe Poulet au vinaigre as Chabrol\'s\nthird first film - after Le Beau Serge (1958) and Les Biches (1967) -\nthe relaunch worked. The critical and popular success of the film\nresulted in a sequel, Inspecteur Lavardin (1986), and a television\nseries for TFI, Les Dossiers de l\'inspecteur Lavardin.\n    Jean Lavardin (Jean Poiret) is a virtuous variant on the Chabrolian\nintruder, in search of \'un petit peu de verite\',8 in a provincial town\nand specifically within a single household. Poulet au vinaigre is\nessentially a film about a house: the Cunos\'s ramshackle home is\nnot just the site of Filamo\'s intended purchase but also, as\nLavardin tells Louis (Lucas Belvaux), the place where the deaths of\nDelphine and Filiol, the disappearance of Anna and the cryptic\nnotes from Tristan all intersect. But the crucial death haunting the\nfilm remains that of Monsieur Cuno, an event which has turned\nthe Cuno house into the realm of the dead father. Hence the\nwedding anniversary dinner where three places are set, one for\nMadame Cuno (Stephane Audran), one for Louis, and one for the\ninvisible guest. Like the van Horn mansion in Ten Days\' Wonder,\nalthough for different reasons, the family home has become a\nshrine to the past. When Lavardin enters the house (the only\ncharacter to do so, apart from Louis himself and the firemen at the\nend of the film) Madame Cuno invokes the ghost of her dead\nhusband, telling Louis to throw the detective out, \'ou j\'appelle ton\npere!\'.\'9 It is in fact Lavardin alone, in his role as replacement for\n\n\n18 \'a little bit of truth\'\n19 \'or I\'ll call your father!\'\n\f104    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n the dead man and as surrogate father, who can free Louis from the\n house. To this extent, Lavardin succeeds and corrects Paul Regis\nfrom Ten Days\' Wonder: Lavardin will free his brow-beaten protege\nfrom the family sphere, where Paul killed his. At the conclusion of\n Poulet au vinaigre, Louis may have lost his mother (Madame Cuno\nis taken to hospital having set fire to the house) but he has gained\na surrogate father in Lavardin and a girlfriend in Henriette. It is\n Lavardin himself who sends Louis to Henriette, both granting\nhim freedom from the childhood home, and absolving him of\n Filiol\'s murder. In other words, he lets Louis go twice over, once\nin his role as detective and once in his role as surrogate father.\n Lavardin\'s virtue is that he only finds out guilt to absolve it; he only\nassumes paternal authority to relinquish it. However, not even he\nseems to realise that in liberating Louis from one emotionally\npossessive maternal figure (Madame Cuno), he is simply deliver-\ning him to another (Henriette). The ending is thus characteristic-\nally double-edged.\n    In Inspecteur Lavardin, the detective makes a second appearance\nas a surrogate father. Arriving in Brittany to investigate the\nmurder ofhardline Catholic author Raoul Mons, Lavardin (again\nplayed by Jean Poiret) discovers that the victim\'s widow Helene\n(Bernadette Laffont) is an old flame of his. Gradually, Lavardin\nassumes Raoul\'s position within the household, in particular with\nregard to Helene and to Veronique, her daughter by an earlier\nmarriage. This paternal role is only dissolved at the end of the\nfilm, when the lone cop makes his escape under the pretence of\nreturning to his own family (showing Veronique a fake family\nphoto). Not only does Lavardin assume Raoul\'s patriarchal place\nin the household, he even begins to take on the latter\'s authori-\ntarian moral position. Just as Raoul is revealed as a hypocritical\nlibertine in moralist\'s clothing (trafficking in drugs and sex at\nMax\'s nightclub), so Lavardin becomes involved in a moralistic\nquest to close down the club and to correct the activities of Raoul\nand Max. Lavardin\'s new-found patriarchal authoritarianism is\nbest shown when he tells Veronique to take off her make·up (she\nhas been to the night-club in secret) so as not to let her mother see\nher looking like a whore (,une pute\'). Identity is inverted\n\f                                                       FAMilY PLOTS        105\n\n\nthroughout Inspecteur Lavardin, and it is not just Lavardin and\nRaoul who are involved. The entire film is structured on a series of\nreversals: the lone cop becomes a family man and the puritan a\nbigot; the gay Frands is in fact straight; the dead come to life\n(Veronique\'s father Pierre Manguin, suspected dead, reappears as\nPeter Guinman)\'o and the living appear dead (the recurrent shots\nof Helene sitting or lying, deaf, mute and staring into space as if\ncomatose); the guilty are innocent (Lavardin absolves Veronique\nand Claude of responsibility for Raoul\'s death) and the innocent\nguilty (Max, the target of Lavardin\'s moralistic quest, is framed for\nthe murder). And the anti-authoritarian rogue cop of Poulet au\nvinaigre comes in Inspecteur Lavardin to represent la loi du pere, the\npower of the patriarchal law.\n\nThematically, the decade or so after the Helene cycle sees Chabrol\nworking through family plots and exploring different models of\nfatherhood. In particular, he represents the family as a paternal\nspace. Only in Les Noces rouges is the bourgeois home convention-\nally represented as matriarchal. In Ten Days\' Wonder, Une partie de\nplaisir, Blood Relatives, Poulet au vinaigre and Inspecteur Lavardin,\nthe house is a patriarchal space. Even when the father or husband\nis absent, dead or supposed dead, as in Les Innocents aux mains sales,\nPoulet au vinaigre and Inspecteur Lavardin, the family home remains\npermeated by his presence. Thus the surviving mother-wife\n(Julie, Madame Cuno, Helene), like the house itself, is haunted by\nthe departed male." The husband\'s possession of the domestic\nspace even in his absence, expressed by the family and guests\'\nominous wait for Paul\'s arrival in Que la bite meure, is almost\nexactly replicated by Theo\'s first appearance in Ten Days\' Wonder,\nand is later developed in the spatial composition of Les Innocents\naux mains sales, where Julie\'s lonely wandering through house\nand garden is anchored by the iterative shots of the spiral stair-\ncase, the site of Louis\'s voyeuristic power and invisible presence.\n\n20   The actual process of reversal is encapsulated in the scene where Lavardin\n     reveals Pierre\'s change of name from Man-guin to Guin·man.\n2I   In Inspecteur Lavardin, Helene is in fact haunted by her first husband, the\n     supposedly dead Pierre, rather than by her second, the actually dead Raoul.\n\f106     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nThe association of male authority with the power of looking is\nelaborated in a number oflater thrillers by Chabrol, notably in the\npatriarchal protagonists of Masques (1986) and Dr M (1990).\nInvisible, all-seeing and manipulative, they control family,\nentourage and television audience by means of an omniscient,\ndivine gaze, as we shall see shortly.\n\n\n\nReferences\nBataille.

Eric Rohmer gives an account of\ncinematic voyeurism which is worth quoting at length:\n     the theme concerns the very essence of cinema, which is seeing,\n     spectacle. A man watches and waits while we watch this man and\n     wait for what he is waiting for ... In a manner of speaking, the\n     crime is desired by the man who expects to make of his discovery\n     his supreme delectation, the very sense of his life. The crime is\n     desired by us, the spectators, who fear nothing so much as seeing\n     our hopes deceived. (Rohmer and Chabrol 1957: 124-5)1\nAccording to Rohmer, this \'theory of spectacle implies a theory of\nspace\' (ibid.: 124). In other words, the voyeur is outside looking in\nat a framed image. To the spatial power of the outsider looking in\n- and in Chabrol especially, looking down too, as in Les Innocents\naux mains sales (1975) or La Ciremonie (1995) - is added the\nemotional power of fantasy or desire, which motivates the voyeur\'s\ngaze. Hence the subjective nature of what the voyeur sees (or\nclaims to see): the windows the photographer looks at in Rear\nWindow become \'the projections of the voyeur\'s thoughts - or\ndesires; he will never be able to find in them more than he had put\nthere\' (ibid.: 126). This concept clearly informs L\'(Eil du malin\n(1961), Chabrol\'s first exploration of voyeurism, but also\nForestier\'s perception of Juliette at her window in Le Cri du hibou\n\n I   Italics in original.\n\f108      ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n(1987) and Paul\'s visions of Nelly\'s infidelity in L\'Enftr (1994). In\nthese films, as in Rear Window, the voyeur\'s \'passion to know, or\nmore exactly to see, will end by suffocating all other feelings\' (ibid.:\n125). Apparently in accordance with psychoanalytical film theory,\nthe obsessive male gaze, dynamised by varying degrees of\npathological desire, objectifies (and even kills) the voyeur\'s female\nvictims. In Chabrol\'s cinema, this gaze operates not only within\nthe voyeuristic thriller, but also, as we have seen, within the family\nplot, where the victim may be male or female: witness Ten Days\'\nWonder (1971) and Les Innocents aux mains sales (1975). It is this\nspatial and, ultimately, political power of the patriarchal gaze over\na family, a community, and indeed a whole city, which Chabrol\nelaborates in Masques (1986) and Dr M (1990).\n\n\n\nMasques\nThe gaze simultaneously demonised and celebrated in Masques\n(1986) is that of the apparently all-powerful game-show host,\nLegagneur (Phillipe Noiret). Like Theo\'s in Ten Days\' Wonder,\nLegagneur\'s name is suggestive of his status and his authority\nover an awed entourage.\' Here, this includes willing servants and\nhelpers as well as Catherine (Anne Brochet), his drugged and\ndocile god-daughter. The intruder-cum-detective (the equivalent\nof Paul Regis in Ten Days\' Wonder) is Legagneur\'s supposed\nbiographer, Wolf (Robin Renucci), As Wolf\'s investigation\ndevelops, the rivalry between the two men becomes a battle to\nclaim possession of Catherine and her huge inheritance. Although\nincreasingly deadly, the contest is never wholly serious, the ludic\nelement (the rivals play tennis and chess, and share a love of\nwordplay) tending above all to reveal the similarities between\nLegagneur and Wolf. Ultimately Catherine, like Louis in Poulet au\nvinaigre (1985), escapes from the control of one possessive (god-)\nparent only to submit to the control of a younger version. As a\nresult, like many of Chabrol\'s films, and above all Que la bete\n\n 2   Legagneur means \'the winner\' and Theo means \'god\'.\n\f                                         THE POWER OF THE GAZE   109\n\n\nmeure (1969), which also concerns the apparent defeat of a\nmonster by a seemingly virtuous hero, Masques can be read two\nways. Superficially, Legagneur is a crook and a bully, while Wolfis\na white knight riding to Catherine\'s rescue. But Wolf is perhaps\njust as materialistic and unscrupulous as Legagneur (just a\nyounger version). Hence the parallels established between the two,\nparticularly in the cross-cutting between them during the garden\nscene, and in Legagneur\'s final warning to Catherine to beware of\nWolf, \'jeune loup aux dents longues\')\n   The overriding discourse in Masques (expressed both verbally\nand visually) is the discourse oflooking. This is particularly true of\nthe relations between Legagneur, Catherine, and Wolf, in which\npower is equated with the gaze and impotence with blindness.\nWolfs purpose, as he tells her, is to open Catherine\'s eyes to her\ngodfather\'s true nature (without of course appearing in anything\nother than a good light himself). His own self-regarding nature is\nreflected in a series of compositions that show Wolf looking at\nhimself in the mirror. By contrast, Catherine is unable to control\nher own gaze. Her eyes, apparently damaged, are protected by\ndark glasses. This poor sight is paralleled by a metaphorical blind-\nness towards Legagneur\'s machinations. When she does express\nher own sense of self, it is as blind and vulnerable (the sculpture of\nherself, blindfolded) or as the object of a predatory male gaze:\nwhen she and Wolfkiss for the first time, she tells him, \'Embrassez-\nmoi, en me regardant tres fort\'.4 Ultimately, having transferred\nher naive affections from Legagneur to Wolf, she declares that\n\'Vos yeux sont entres dans les miens et je vois clair maintentant\'.s\nBut for most of the film, Wolfs gaze is no match for Legagneur\'s.\nThe television host\'s authority, originally derived from his\nmanipulation of the visual medium, manifests itself as a gaze so\nunbearably powerful that he has to sleep blindfold, with the\nwindows closed and the curtains tightly drawn. Like Theo in Ten\nDays\' Wonder, he seems to watch over his household even when\nabsent. But where Theo expresses this possibility hypothetically\n\n3 ·the voracious young wolf\n4 \'Kiss me, staring at me very hard\'\n5 \'Your eyes looked into mine and I can see clearly now\'\n\f110   CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n (saying to Hel€~ne \'I wish 1 could always watch you - and you not\nknow I\'m there\'), the camerawork in Masques grants Legagneur\nthis power literally. In a crucial meal-time scene, from which\nLegagneur is absent, Wolf begins to ask questions about his own\nsister\'s mysterious disappearance from the house. The secretary\'s\nresponse that \'11 faudrait demander a Monsieur Legagneur\'6 is the\ncue for a switch of camera angle from one side of the table to the\nother, breaking the traditional 180 rule, as Chabrol gives us the\n                                          0\n\n\nhost\'s point of view, shot from his vacant chair. The suggestion\nhere that Legagneur possesses a divine gaze, invisible, ubiquitous,\nand disconnected from his corporeal presence, is underlined\nwhen Wolf warns Catherine to beware of \'la figure de Dieu. C\'est\nune figure tres commune, et tres dangereuse\') Not only is\nLegagneur Catherine\'s godfather, he also assumes the ostensibly\nbeneficent authority of God the Father in his own household, and\nplays a (falsely) paternal role as host to contestants in their second\nchildhood on his game-show Bonheur pour to us.\n    To these patriarchal connotations, again reminiscent of the\ncharacterisation of Theo in Ten Days\' Wonder (although handled\nmore lightly) is added the technical significance of the invisible\ngaze in the construction of fIlmic space. In the scene under\ndiscussion, the absent Legagneur (denoted by the point-of-view\nshot) assumes the traditional site of the camera - known as the\n\'invisible guest\' - in the composition of classical meal-table\nsequences. Thus Legagneur\'s gaze is at once the gaze of God and\nthe gaze of the camera, two figures that Chabrol also combines in\nthe portrayal of the nightclub owner Max from Inspecteur Lavardin\n(1986) and the media megalomaniac Marsfeldt from Dr M (1990).\nIn all three cases, the conflation of the eye of God and the eye of\nthe camera is associated with the power of television. The\nmetaphor is first introduced in Inspecteur Lavardin, when Chabrol\ntracks slowly towards the ceiling in Max\'s studio to reveal a hidden\nvideo camera in the centre of the canopy. The perspective from\nthis hidden camera, looking down on Claude as he discovers the\n\n\n6 \'You will have to ask Monsieur Legagneur\'\n7 \'the face of God. It\'s a very common face, and a dangerous one\'\n\f                                             THE POWER OF THE GAZE              111\n\n\ncrime scene, has been described by Chabrol as \'comme le point de\nvue de Dieu\'s (Chevrie and Toubiana 1986: 12).\n    In Masques, television is not just the seat of Legagneur\'s power\nbut also an Orwellian weapon which subjugates the viewer: \'Dans\nce dispositif televisuel ideal, on ne regarde plus, on est regarde.\nOn est situe par l\'autre, incapable de se situer et de le situer\'9\n(Magny 1987: 184). Hence Legagneur\'s refusal to watch Bonheur\npour tous (or any other programme, it seems). As he tells Wolf, his\nown television audience (like the elderly contestants) are passive\nand weak, needing \'protection\' (read: control). The clips of the\ngame-show that punctuate the film show that television exercises\ncontrol largely through direct audience address: hence the shot of\na contestant singing directly to the camera that starts the film, the\nflashing sign reading \'Applaudissez\'Io which follows, or the\nfrontal shots of Legagneur. In all of these cases, and most obvi-\nously in the final scene of the film, Chabrol exploits the ambi-\nvalence of the frontal composition: it is not just the game-show\naudience (in the studio and in front of the television), but also the\ncinema spectators of Masques, who are being addressed. This\nallows Chabrol to have Legagneur, on the point of being arrested\non air during his last show, to insult not only the television\naudience but the cinema audience too: \'Mesdames et messieurs, il\nne me reste qU\'une chose a vous dire, du fond du creur: je vous\nemmerde!\'.II The direct address to camera here works not just as a\nrevelation of the host\'s true feelings, but also as a parodic exagger-\nation of film theory which posits the spectator as a passive object\nof manipulation by the medium. Beginning with Hitchcock\'s\nwell-known thoughts on controlling the Psycho audience - \'I was\ndirecting the viewers. You might say I was playing them, like an\norgan\' (Truffaut 1984: 269) - this tendency, in its most extreme\nform, results in the conclusion that \'The visible is essentially\npornographic, which is to say that it has its end in rapt, mindless\n 8 \'like God\'s point of view\'.\n  9 \'In this ideal televisual mechanism, one no longer watches, one is watched. One\n    is positioned by the other, unable to position oneself or them.\'\n10 \'Applaud\'\n11 \'Ladies and gentlemen, there remains only one thing for me to say to you, from\n    the bottom of my heart: bugger you!\'\n\f112     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nfascination\' (Jameson 1990: 1).12 But in Chabrol it is only ever\ntelevision (and never cinema) which is seen to objectify the specta·\ntor in this way, often to deadly effect, as in Dr M and La Cirimonie\n (1995)·\n\n\n\nLe Cri du hibou\nMasques continued Chabrol\'s mid-1980s renaissance under the\nauspices of the producer Marin Karmitz. But Karmitz refused to\nproduce or even distribute three of Chabrol\'s next four films, Le\nCri du hibou (1987), Dr M and Jours tranquilles a Clichy (1990).\nWhile his judgement is certainly borne out by the latter, a deci-\ndedly limp adaptation of Henry Miller\'s novel, and undoubtedly\none ofChabrol\'s worst films, both Le Cri du hibou and Dr M develop\nin various ways the exploration of voyeurism and power begun in\nMasques.\n   Le Cri du hibou begins as Masques ends, with a framed image\nfrom which the camera slowly tracks back to reveal the presence of\na spectator. In this case, the image is of a young woman, Juliette\n(Mathilda May), seen at the window of her house by Forestier\n(Christophe Malavoy), a voyeur hiding in the darkness of the\ngarden. Just as the meal-table shot in Masques mimics the classic\nconstruction of filmic space, so this typically significant pre-credit\nsequence refers to the dreamlike space of the cinema experience.\nPsychoanalytical film theory has long compared the experience of\nwatching films in a darkened cinema with the process of dream-\ning and fantasising. Chabrol\'s composition here -like the murder\nscene in L\'CBil du malin (1961) - evokes just that synthesis of\nlooking and dreaming via the darkened space between the\nspectator in the foreground and the image of the girl illuminated\nand framed in the background. Juliette thus assumes the\nreassuring and dreamlike beauty that the filmstar holds for the\ncinemagoer. But as Forestier belatedly realises, \'Les images de\n\n12   My italics. Linda Williams cites this as an example of how film theory has\n     tended to vilify \'the gaze\' in her seminal 1993 lecture. Visual Culture and\n     Spectatorial Discipline.\n\f                                         THE POWER OF THE GAZE            113\n\n\nreve sont destinees aux reves. 11 ne faut pas les introduire dans la\nvie\' .\') The \'zone mixte et confuse\' between \'le spectacle et la vie"4\ntraditionally inhabited by films tars (Morin 1972: 8) will, in Le Cri\ndu hibou, be the site of a fatal confusion. Like the professor in Fritz\nLang\'s The Woman in the Window (1944), Forestier, by projecting\nhis own fantasy on to the image of a woman, will generate a vortex\nof violence and death.\n    This deadly process begins when Forestier introduces himself\nto Juliette and admits that he has been spying on her for three\nmonths. Divorced, psychologically unstable and prone to depress-\nion, he has found an apparent symbol of happiness and normality\nin the image of Juliette: \'Cette image de vous derriere la fenetre,\nenfin, pour moi, c\'etait une image tres belle, tres rassurante\' .\'S But\nhis interpretation of what he sees is purely subjective, and is\nrefuted by Juliette herself. His comment that \'Vous aviez l\'air\nheureux dans votre maison, avec votre fiance\',6 is met with a reply\nwhich encapsulates Chabrol\'s attitude to appearances: \'11 y a des\nairs qui trompent\'.\'7 Forestier believes Juliette to be happy and\nsatisfied when, objectively, she is nothing of the sort. Moreover,\nhe has inadvertently destroyed what little happiness and stability\nshe had. After meeting Forestier, she grows dissatisfied with her\nfiance Patrick and increasingly fascinated by the enigmatic\nvoyeur. And while she represents for Forestier the essence oflife\n(home. family, happiness, stability, continuation), Juliette is in\nfact drawn towards death by her growing friendship with the voyeur.\nHis reserve and mystery serve to feed her own morbid obsessions:\nshe shows him photographs of her dead brother, and finally\ncomes to believe that Forestier is the personification of death. His\nmorbid persona is enhanced by Malavoy\'s detached performance,\nwhich is based on the theory that Forestier is a man back from the\ndead (Toubiana 1988: 8). For all his charm and restraint. Forestier\nis indeed a bird of evil omen, a bird of prey like those he habitually\n[3 \'Dream images are meant for dreams. One must not introduce them into life\'\n[4 \'mixed and confused space\' between \'spectacle and life\'\n[5 \'That image of you at the window, well, for me, it was very beautiful, very\n   comforting\'\n[6 \'You looked happy in your house, with your fiance\'\n[7 \'Appearances can be deceptive\'\n\f114    CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\ndraws and photographs. (When he tells Juliette they must not see\neach other any more, it is under the gaze of a huge photograph of\nan eagle hung on his wall.) These predatory and nocturnal conno-\ntations are complemented by the association of Forestier with the\nowl, whose fateful cry is heard on the deaths of Juliette, Patrick,\nand Yeronique (for all of which Forestier is indirectly responsible.)\nJust as, in L\'CEil du malin, Albin\'s perception of the Hartmanns as\npresenting \'un univers rond, parfait, ou tout est harmonieux\',8 is\nonly the prelude to Helene\'s murder by her husband, so, by the\nend of Le Cri du hibou, Forestier\'s projection of \'une image tres\nbelle, tres rassurante\' on to Juliette has resulted in her suicide and\nthree other violent deaths. The gaze of the voyeur, apparently\ndetached and innocent, is nothing of the sort: it is the gaze of the\nMedusa, killing all it sees.\n   Within this portrayal of predatory voyeurism is a secondary\naccount of the power of looking, which concerns the reversal of\nForestier\'s gaze. Although for most of the film Chabrol\'s use of\nsubjective camera gives Forestier\'s point of view, as events begin\nto spiral out of control the voyeur becomes an object of the gaze\nrather than its bearer. This is first apparent when, in a repetition\nof the pre-credit sequence, the camera tracks back from a shot of\nForestier and Juliette together inside her house to reveal a voyeur,\nSuzie, watching from outside. By abandoning his position of\npower and entering the house, Forestier has made himself the\nobject of a hostile gaze. The principle is repeated when Patrick\nwatches Juliette and Forestier in the latter\'S house at night.\nAccording to the \'theory of space\' which Rohmer applies to Rear\nWindow, by moving inside, the former voyeur submits himself to\nan outside gaze, and to the powerful desires that motivate that\ngaze. In this case, the gaze is overtly malicious (rather than simply\nmisguided, as is Forestier\'s). Suzie and Patrick represent the\njudgemental gaze of the local community, which has decided that\nForestier is a deranged criminal. (Chabrol\'s choice of setting is\nrelevant here: Vichy has become synonymous with the paranoia\nand suspicion of the Occupation; Le Cri du hibou might almost\n\n18 \'a round. perfect universe where everything is in harmony\'\n\f                                           THE POWER OF THE GAZE             115\n\n\nhave been called L\'(Eit de Vichy).\'9 The culmination of this theme\ncomes when, shot and wounded in the arm by Patrick, Forestier\nlies on a couch as a crowd of neighbours peer in at the window.\nVulnerable and immobilised, he is explicitly objectified. In the\nprevious scene, he had complained to the police that \'On a bien le\ndroit de regarder les gens\'.·o But, as the vicious gaze of his neigh-\nbours and the fatal consequences of his own voyeurism both bear\nout, in Le Cri du hibou looking is a crime after all.\n\n\n\nDrM\nDr M (1990) was conceived as a tribute to Fritz Lang, whose film\nThe Testament of Dr Mabuse (1933) first made Chabrol want to\nwork in cinema. Released to coincide with the centenary of Lang\'s\nbirth in 1890, Dr M was shot on the same site in Berlin as Dr\nMabuse, the Gambler (1922) and The Thousand Eyes of Dr Mabuse\n(1960) and is in part a homage to Lang\'s Mabuse series. Hence the\nall-seeing megalomaniac villain, the gambling references, and the\nimportance of expressionism in the mise en scene. Chabrol\'s film is\nalso a topical investigation of its time, as were both the first and\nsecond Mabuse films (decadence in the Weimar Republic and the\nrise of Nazism, respectively). Dr M features AIDS (the \'sickness\'\nor \'epidemic\' of the \'suicide virus\'), the power of television, the\nmanipulation of female icons (Sonia) and images of children\n(Marsfeldt\'s broadcast ala Saddam Hussein), the psychobabble of\nnew-age therapies (Club Theratos), and, most strikingly, the\nfuture reunification of Germany. Shot in autumn 1989, immedi-\nately before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the film is prophetically set\nin a partly unified Berlin.\n    The conflation of the gaze of God and the gaze of television,\nexplored by Chabrol briefly in Inspecteur Lavardin and at length in\n\n19   L\'am de Vichy is actually the name of Chabrol\'s 1993 anthology of propaganda\n     and newsreels from the Occupation. Le Cri du hibou also features poison·pen\n     letters, written to Forestier\'s employers by Patrick - an echo of Clouzot\'s\n     portrayal of wartime denunciations in Le Corbeau (1943).\n20   \'One does have the right to look at people\'\n\f116   CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n Masques, is embodied in Dr M by the media tycoon Marsfeldt\n(Alan Bates). In Lang\'s The Thousand Eyes of Dr Mabuse the \'eyes\'\nare in fact TV screens used by Mabuse to monitor the other\ncharacters\' movements. Similarly, in Inspecteur Lavardin Max uses\nsurveillance cameras to spy on the clientele (especially the young\nwomen) in his nightclub. And in Dr M, Marsfeldt controls Berliners\nby televisual means. Not only does his position as head of Mater\nMedia give him a practical monopoly over the city\'s television\nchannels, he also manipulates the masses through the huge\n\'video-boards\' positioned throughout the city. His nightclub, Tod\n(,Death\'), features two balconies, vantage points from which he\ncan look down upon the dancefloor and the roulette wheel as his\nvideo screens look down upon Berlin. Marsfeldt himself is part\nman, part robot - at Lang\'s suggestion (Legrand 1991: 41) - and is\ndependent on a life-support machine. As a consequence, he has to\nretreat periodically inside a technological cell, where a bank of\ntelevisions feed him images of war and death, as well as sur-\nveillance pictures from the streets of Berlin.\n    Whereas in Le Cri du hibou the gaze of the voyeur inadvertently\ncauses Juliette\'s suicide, in Dr M the gaze of the television screen\nhas become explicitly deadly. Marsfeldt uses his control of the\nmedium to precipitate a wave of suicides, and hence to generate\nTV images of deaths with which to sustain himself. As detective\nHartmann (Jan Niklas) discovers, the trigger for the suicides is a\nsubliminal message in the video adverts for Marsfeldt\'s holiday\ngroup, Club Theratos. And, in a variation on the figure from Masques\nof the patriarch controlling his female ward, Marsfeldt is the\nadoptive father of the videostar Sonia (J ennifer Beals), \'The "Time\nTo Go" Girl\' whose image looks down on Berlin. Throughout the\nfilm Sonia, like Juliette in Le Cri du hibou, is the focus for a\nrecurrent tension between appearance and reality. She is in one\nsense the Angel of Death, bearing the gaze of the Medusa: her\nimage is both the trigger for the recurrent deaths and, often defaced\nwith the eyes blacked out, the only clue left by the suicides. In one\nstriking shot, her silent gaze stares directly at the spectator from\nthe glossy surface of a \'video-card\'. But she is also a manipulated\norphan, whose submission to her surrogate father is reflected in a\n\f                                              THE POWER OF THE GAZE                117\n\n\nseries of compositions which show her kneeling or sitting beneath\nhim. Through her character and its multiple representations\n(photographs, drawings, paintings, moving images on video-\nboards, TV screens, and the video-card) Chabrol explores the\nunreliability of representation as a measure of truth. Even Sonia\'s\nmirror image is a lie, since in Dr M the mirror is not a reflection of\nthe truth but a false surface which manipulates the viewer, as in\nthe two-way mirror at Club Theratos. First seen in her disembodied\nform, addressing Berlin from a huge screen, Sonia only manages\nto replace her own representation with her real self in the\nclimactic scene of the \'final broadcast\', when she \'goes out live\'.\nFor, like an inversion ofJuliette, Sonia is in fact an embodiment of\nlife whose image erroneously suggests death.\n    For all its faults - Alan Bates\'s hammy performance as Mars-\nfeldt, the dubbing of several German actors into English, and the\nformulaic basis for the plot, in which a lone cop, thrown off the\ncase, confronts a web of corruption and manipulation - Dr M is a\nfascinating film and a brilliant example of how Chabrol follows\nLang in matching style to substance. The film is realised in a flat,\nglossy style which tends to rely, like Lang, on a limited number of\n(mostly static) shots. This Langian economy of style - particularly\nevident in the pre-credit sequence detailing three different\nsuicides - is also reminiscent of television, as Chabrol has admitted:\n     Le principe de depart etait un pur hommage a Lang et au fur et a\n     mesure je me suis aper~u que c\'etait impossible. Et j\'ai trouve une\n     autre solution, ... c\'etait de montrer comment un style pur ne peut\n     que se degrader, comment il peut se transformer en un style de\n     feuilleton tele. Car tous les feuilletons-tele - en particulier Kojak -\n     ont le style abatardi des films de Lang." (Jousse and Toubiana\n     199 2 : 35)\n\n\n21   \'The starting-point was a pure homage to Lang, and then as things developed I\n     realised that that was impossible. And I found another solution ... ; it was to\n     show how a pure style can only deteriorate, how it can turn into the style of a TV\n     series. Because all TV series - especially Kojak - have a style which is a\n     bastardised version of Lang\'s films\'. See also Chabrol cited in Gristwood 1990:\n     \'Lang is an example I try to follow ... Not to use two shots when you only need\n     one. No movement when you can do without it\'.\n\f118     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nWith its directness, simplicity, and televisual (rather than cinematic)\nnature, Chabrol\'s shooting style in Dr M is immediate and effec-\ntive. Combined with the dark, other-worldly music of Hindemith 22\n(a rare use of symphonic score rather than the film music of Pierre\nJansen or Matthieu Chabrol) and an expressionist attention to\narchitecture, the result is a polished but Germanic quality which\nagain harks back to Lang. The thematic significance of the\nexpressionist mise en scene is especially apparent in the extended\nsequence which sees Sonia and Hartmann make love in his\nbedroom while Marsfeldt satisfies himself with images of death in\nhis studio-cum-cell. While the cross-cutting between the two\nscenes establishes an ironic parallel between sex and death (comic-\nally underlined when Marsfeldt, sated, lights up a post-coital\ncigar), the decor emphasises a shared sense of imprisonment. As\nMarsfeldt later declares, Berliners lead an \'existence defined by\nthe idea of escape\' (here the fact that the city of the film is only\npartially unified allows Chabrol to exploit the metaphor of the\nWall). In short, Sonia, Hartmann and Marsfeldt, like all Berliners,\nare living in a box. The expressionist presentation of this theme\ninvolves the visual motif of black boxes or checks on a white\nbackground, a pattern which is repeated in the banks of TV\nscreens at Club Theratos and the design of the police station floor.\nIn the sequence in question, the black-and-white box motif occurs\nin at least ten individual shots, principally in the pattern of the\nduvet and the screen in Hartmann\'s bedroom and in the barred\nglass walls of Marsfeldt\'s cell, but also, more subtly, in the static\nshots of Berlin which immediately follow: Sonia\'s image framed\non a video-board on the walls of various buildings; a newspaper\nhoarding with the photographs of six dead children set out in\nrows; lines of cars in a traffic jam; a row of square windows in a\nblock of flats. Ultimately, the entire city is assimilated to a screen,\na box, a prison.\n\n\n\n\n22   Hindemith\'s works, like those of Lang, were banned in Nazi Germany. Like\n     Lang in 1934, Hindemith fled Germany for the USA in 1940.\n\f                                         THE POWER OF THE GAZE            119\n\n\nL\'En/er\n\nDr M and L\'Enfor (1994) reflect two distinct approaches to the theme\nof the gaze, as well as two distinct approaches to cinema, via the\nrespective influences of Chabrol\'s masters, Lang and Hitchcock.\nWhere the Langian Dr M concerns the socio-political theme of\nsurveillance, encapsulated in the metaphor of the two-way mirror,\nthe Hitchockian L\'Enfor explores the personal realm of fantasy,\nexpressed by the metaphor of projection (in both senses of the\nword). And where in Dr M the touchstone was Lang\'s Mabuse\nseries, in L\'Enfor it is Hitchcock\'s Vertigo (1958), already reworked\nby Chabrol thirty years earlier in L\'(Ea du malin. In particular, the\nscenes in which Paul (Franc;:ois Cluzet) trails his wife Nelly\n(Emmanuelle Beart) recall both Scottie following Madeleine in\nVertigo and Albin following Helene in L\'(Eil du malin. The genesis\nof L\' Enfor also has a more direct source in the aborted film of the\nsame name, begun by Henri-Georges Clouzot in 1964 but aban-\ndoned after a month due to the director\'s heart trouble. In 1993,\nClouzot\'s widow offered the rights to Marin Karmitz, Chabrol\'s\nproducer, and the project was resurrected. But while for Clouzot\nhell is to be found in \'la relation sadomasochiste entre l\'homme et\nla femme\'zJ (Jeancolas 1994: 65), for Chabrol hell resides in the\ngulf between reality and one man\'s obsessive fantasies.\n    In terms of both style and theme, L\'Enforis cinematic where Dr\nM is televisual. Stylistically, key sequences such as those in which\nPaul follows Nelly provide \'de magnifiques moments de cinema ...\nqui soudent le spectateur bouche bee au defilement des images\'Z4\n(Taboulay I994: 36-7). Thematically, the crucial, filmic metaphor\nof projection is established early on when Paul, alerted by the\nflashes of the projector, catches Nelly and Martineau (Marc Lavoine)\nwatching slides together in the dark. This discovery first arouses\nPaul\'s suspicions about his wife\'s infidelity. From this point on,\nhe moves rapidly from being the object of filming (when Mon-\nsieur Duhamel shoots him with his movie-camera) to creating his\nown hallucinatory film-cum-fantasy, with Nelly as the supposedly\n23 \'the sado-masochistic relationship between men and women\'\n24 \'magnificent cinematic moments ... which unite the spectator. open-mouthed,\n   with the stream ofimages\'\n\f120     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nadulterous protagonist. At first it seems that his jealousy is actually\nanchored in reality, given Nelly\'s flirtatious demeanour and eva-\nsive responses to his questions. Accusing his wife of persisting in\nher supposed affair with Martineau, Paul tells her that his jealousy\nis logical. She replies that \'C\'est \'logique, mais c\'est pas vrai\'." For\nChabrol, who tends to film the truth no matter how illogical it\nseems - witness especially the fait divers films such as Landru\n(1963) and Violette Noziere (1978) - Paul\'s \'logical\' untruth is a\nterrible error. As L\'Enfor progresses, the slippage between truth\nand fiction, between objective reality and Paul\'s subjective fantasy,\nbecomes increasingly apparent.\n    Chabrol\'s meticulous recording of Paul\'s paranoia involves\nsounds as well as images. In fact, it is the soundtrack which\nprovides the first indications of his mental instability, and which\nmost frequently leads us into his fantasy world. Where Clouzot\'s\noriginal screenplay spoke of \'le fracas des trains qui passent en\nhurlant sur l\'immense viaduc de fer\'26 (Jeancolas 1994: 64),\nChabrol uses the roar of jets passing overhead, complemented at\nvarious times by the crying of Paul and Nelly\'s baby son, the buzz·\ning of bees or flies, Paul\'s own interior monologue, and even the\ncomically apt song L\'Enfer de mes nuits ne t\'attendrai toute la nuit\n/ jalousie pour toute compagnie\').\'7 The first sign of Paul\'s\nanxiety, and the first instance of interior monologue, is in reaction\nto his son\'s crying, while both the slide-show scene and Duhamel\'s\nfilming of Paul are heralded by the sound of jets. That Paul\'s \'film\'\nof Nelly\'s infidelity has its own soundtrack as well as imagery is\nmade clear when, returning from town in the car, his memory of\nthe sound of her footsteps is the prelude to a fantasy sequence.\nLater, when he follows her from the shore of the lake, his pursuit\nis punctuated by a cacophony of buzzing insects, roaring jets and a\nsnatch of L\'Enfor de mes nuits. This attention to sound effects as an\nindex of the imaginary recalls Luis Bunuel\'s BeUe de jour (1967). In\nthe ambiguous ending of Belle de jour, the sound of bells alone\ndenotes that we are seeing Severine\'s fantasy, while the image\n\n25 \'It\'s logical, but it\'s not true\'\n26 \'the roar of the trains screaming by on the huge iron viaduct\'\n27 \'I\'ll wait for you all night I alone with my jealousy\'\n\f                                            THE POWER OF THE GAZE              121\n\n\ntrack offers no obvious clue. Like Chabrol, Buiiuel asks what is\nreal and what is simply a projection of the protagonist\'s desires.\n But for the surrealist Buiiuel, the implication is that the solipsistic\nrealm of fantasies and desires is just as vital as what is known as\nreality. For Chabrol, by contrast, no illusion or dream (be it personal\nor political) is worth fostering at the expense of a lucid realism.\n    The course of Paul\'s descent from jealous anxiety to murder-\nous paranoia is charted by half a dozen fantasy sequences inter-\nspersed throughout the narrative. These sequences in effect mark\nhalf a dozen stages in \'la destruction du bonheur d\'un couple qui\nvisait precisement a donner une trop belle image du bonheur\'·8\n(Taboulay 1994: 36). The deceptively reassuring images of harmony\nin L\'CEU du malin and Le Cri du hibou are destroyed by the intrusive\nvoyeurs Albin and Forestier. But in L\'Enfor, the typical Chabrolian\ntriangle is reduced to the couple, and the image of domestic bliss\nis eroded from within. This is a process not without its moments\nof black humour. As Paul dashes through the town. following\nNelly to some imagined rendez-vous with Martineau, he passes a\nwedding scene as idyllic as his own at the start of the film. And the\nfamily enjoying a picnic by the side of the lake as Paul rushes past,\nagain in pursuit of his wife. are a parody of the happy picture his\nfamily made before his jealousy took hold. In the crucial film-\nshow sequence, Paul replaces the objective images of Nelly (shot\nby Duhamel and shown to the assembled guests in the hotel) with\nhis own imaginary home movie (complete with paranoid voice-\nover. and L\'Enfor de mes nuits as theme song). The filmic nature of\nPaul\'s paranoia is reiterated during the storm, when the flashes of\nlightning recall the slide-show and the film-show. and thus\nprecipitate the projection of Paul\'s fantasies once more.\n    L\'Enfor concludes with two endings, one in which Paul kills\nNelly. and one in which he fantasises her murder. then recovers\nhis lucidity long enough to realise that he can no longer tell what is\nreal and what is imagined. But the clear encoding of fantasy\nthroughout the film implies that, unlike the cryptic ending of\n\n\n28 \'the destruction of a couple\'s happiness, precisely for having wanted to present\n   a too beautiful image of happiness\'\n\f122      CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n Bunuel\'s Belle de jour - or indeed of several of Chabrol\'s films,\nincluding Le Beau Serge (1958) and Que la bete meure (1969) - the\nending of L\'EnJer is not totally ambiguous. That the murder of\n Nelly is a fantasy seems to be made clear by the roaring of jets and\nthe wailing of sirens on the soundtrack, coupled with a burst of\nflash-back images which combines objectively filmed events with\nscenes from Paul\'s previous hallucinations and glimpses of the\napparent murder. The most obvious parallel is in fact with Folies\nbourgeoises (1976), another film which details the destruction ora\nmarried couple from within, and towards the end of which William\n (Bruce Dern) fantasises that he has murdered his wife Claire\n (Stephane Audran). Here, the fantasy is signalled as such by a\nwhited-out screen in the preceding shot, and by the continuation\nof the narrative, which reveals that Claire is still alive and that\nWilliam is merely in the act of brushing his teeth (just as Paul is\nshaving while he appears to imagine killing Nelly). But where\nWilliam is lucid, and thus able to embark on the tentative reconci-\nliation that closes Folies bourgeoises, Paul is not, and consequently\ncannot be sure (even if the spectator is) that he has not killed Nelly.\nIn Le Cri du hibou Chabrol reveals that what the voyeur chooses to\nsee is a projection of his own fantasies. By the end of L\'EnJer,\nPaul\'s fantasies have been interiorised to the point that the\nblurring of projection and reality is complete, and potentially fatal.\nHe can no longer trust what he sees. Ironically, as the final image\n- Paul\'s view out of the rain-covered window - blurs, and he tries\nto make sense of what has happened, the last word in L\'EnJer is\n\'Voyons .. ."9\n\nThe weakest point in L\'EnJer is the portrayal of Nelly as a bouncy,\ntwo-dimensional extrovert (and, in the later stages, as an equally\ntwo-dimensional victim of rape and, possibly, murder). Although\nthere are narrative reasons for this - to give Paul\'s jealousy a\nplausible origin and a terrifying outcome - it remains evident that\nChabrol\'s characterisation ofNelly as simply an object (of fantasy,\ndesire and paranoia) is a shortcoming. As the scriptwriter of\nClouzot\'s version says:Seulle point de vue de l\'homme est pris en\n29 ·let"s see .. :\n\f                                          THE POWER OF THE GAZE            123\n\n\ncompte. La femme est un personnage qui vit dans la tete de son\nmari\'JO (Bocquet 1997: 95). Such characterisation of women is\ngenerally uncharacteristic of Chabrol. but typical of what has been\ntaken to be classical cinema\'s gender-specific portrayal of the\npower of the gaze. As first posited in the mid-1970s (Mulvey\n1975), film theory has maintained that in conventional cinema at\nleast, the gaze is male and the object of desire female. This\ngeneralisation appears to be borne out by the power relations\nbetween Legagneur and Catherine in Masques, Forestier and\nJuliette in Le Cri du hibou, Marsfeldt and Sonia in Dr M, and Paul\nand Nelly in L\'Enfer. But these are knowing explorations of the\nnature of power rather than unquestioning examples of cinematic\nvoyeurism. As we have seen with regard to Masques and Dr M, the\nparadigms of voyeurism (male voyeur and female object) and of\nthe family (father controlling surrogate daughter) are also\ncomplemented by a wider concern with the nature of television\nand spectatorship. In all three areas, power is shown to be in the\nhands of men, even if it involves self-destruction ultimately (for\nLegagneur, Forestier, Marsfeldt, and even Paul to a degree).\n   As his own comments make clear, Chabrol is strongly aware of\nhistorical power relations between the sexes: \'If there are men,\nwomen are the victims\' (Yakir 1979: 9). But this has not prevented\nhim from portraying a number of female protagonists as\nconfronting patriarchal power rather than submitting to it. This is\nalready evident in La Rupture (1970), where Helene is celebrated\nfor fighting against a bourgeois patriarch. The theme returns in\nseveral later films, made concurrently with those explored in this\nchapter, but detailing the female experience with all the depth and\nsubtlety missing from L\'Enfer.\n\n\n\n\n30 \'Only the man\'s point of view is taken into account. The woman is a character\n   who lives inside her husband\'s head\'\n\f124     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nReferences\nBocquet, J.-L.

In the same\ninterview, he added: \'Plus on cherche a comprendre, moins on\ncomprend. Le vertige que cela procure me plait beaucoup" (ibid.:\n32). This \'vertigo\' - as in Hitchcock\'s films, including Vertigo\n(1958) itself - is felt most strongly in the representation of female\nprotagonists. It is expressed most succinctly in the dreamlike\nimages of women\'s faces suspended in space which dominate\nChabrol\'s films about women, from the coda of Les Bonnes Femmes\n(1960), via the endings of Le Boucher (r969) and Les Innocents aux\nmains sales (1975) to Violette Noziere (1978), Betty (1992) and La\nCeremonie (1995). It seems that Chabrol chooses more and more\nto base his films on stories of women because he shares the\ntraditional (male) view that they are more enigmatic than men.\nBut aside from the Helene cycle - in which Stephane Audran as\nHelene is a personification (half satirical, half idealised) of the\nbourgeoisie - Chabrol does not use his female characters to repre-\nsent abstracts or to symbolise absolutes; they remain socially and\nhistorically defined individuals. There is thus a degree of Marxism\nas well as mystery in their depiction. Women in Chabrol\'s work\n\nI \'In the end, I\'m only interested in the characters, and the more I go on, the more\n  I\'m only interested in the female characters\'\nz \'The more you try to understand, the less you understand. I really like the sense\n  of vertigo which that causes\'\n\f126    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n are often trapped, frustrated or disadvantaged, and this is often a\n matter of social class. But the power relations between the sexes,\nalthough exacerbated by poverty, transcend class. The prevalence\nof patriarchal power structures means that even Chabrol\'s bour-\n geois women are generally dominated by men. As Chabrol says,\n \'If there are men, women are the victims\' (Yakir 1979: 9). This is\n evident in the relations we have noted between autocratic\n patriarchs and their young female wards - Legagneur and Catherine\nin Masques (1986), Marsfeldt and Sonia in Dr M (1990) - and also\nin the marriages shown in Que la bete meure (1969), Ten Days\'\n Wonder (1971), Une partie de plaisir (1974) and L\'Enfer (1994), In\nthese examples, the female characters are usually objects (of desire,\nof exchange, of fantasy). This trend culminates with Nelly in\n L\'EnJer, Chabrol\'s least convincing female character, whose life (and\ndeath) is defined by her husband\'s fantasies. But conversely, as his\n1995 statement suggests, recent years have also seen Chabrol develop\nan ongoing interest in women as subjects rather than objects.\n     Given that in Chabrol\'s cinema women are often lacking in\nfinancial or social power, there are limits to the ways in which they\ncan either define themselves or escape their situation. This is\nspelled out most clearly in Les Bonnes Femmes, where the potential\nescape routes are (in order of appearance in the narrative) sex,\nmarriage into the bourgeoisie, a career, romance, or death. Several\nof these alternatives - notably sex, romance, and marriage into the\nbourgeoisie - also arise in Violette Noziere and Betty. Even the\nbourgeois love affairs in La Femme infidele (1968), Les Noces rouges\n(1973) and Les Innocents aux mains sales are essentially dreams of\nescape which do not provide a solution. The persistence of\nfrustration in a middle-class marriage is also portrayed in Une\npartie de plaisir, where Philippe torments his wife Danielle by\nsuggesting she break the confines of marital fidelity, only to\npunish her when she does so. Eventually he kills her for leaving\nhim. But he also punishes her for seeking her own escape route\nfrom their claustrophobic marriage: a career. When she says she\nis looking for a job, he accuses her of \'bovarysme\'. By comparing\nhis wife to the heroine of Flaubert\'s Madame Bovary, Philippe is\naccusing her of sheltering from reality in a romantic dream. But\n\f                                                  STORIES OF WOMEN             127\n\n\nhe is also establishing a key point of reference for many of\nChabrol\'s female characters: the importance of the imagination as\na means of escape. Although he did not film Flaubert\'s novel until\n1991, Chabrol in a sense had already made several versions of it,\nall of them in fact better than the adaptation itselfl For Jacqueline\nin Les Bonnes Femmes and Violette in Violette Noziere, dreaming is\ntheir prime means of autonomy; like Emma Bovary, they dream\nthemselves away from their lives by reading into their affairs a\npossibility of escape which will prove illusory. This is true of\ncareer ambitions as well as well as romantic ones: witness Ginette\nin Les Bonnes Femmes and Marie in Une affaire de femmes (1988),\nboth of whom dream of being singers. The importance to women\nof negotiating a new identity (be it through dreams or action) is\nemphasised in Les Biches (1967) when Why, dressed as Fn!der-\nique, tells Paul that she always wanted to \'changer de peau\') Paul\nreplies that he cannot see the point, to which Why responds:\n\'Parce que tu es un homme\'.4\n\n\n\nViolette Noziere\n\nThroughout his career, Chabrol has shown a recurrent interest in\nthe fait divers or real-life crime story. This is most obvious in\nLandru (1963), which tells the story of the infamous serial killer,\nand Une affaire de femmes (see below, p. 133), based on the case of\nthe last woman to be guillotined in France. The fait divers also\ninforms the references to Weidmann\'s execution in Les Bonnes\nFemmes and the Bourganeuf murders in Les Noces Rouges, and the\nimplicit parallel with the Pap in sisters in La Ceremonie.5 Even\nMadame Bovary could be said to have afait divers at its origin (the\nsuicide of a local woman was the basis for Flaubert\'s novel). The\ncase ofViolette Noziere, which Chabrol filmed in 1978, is notable\nin that - unlike the others - it concerns the relationship between a\nyoung woman and her family. In 1933, at the age of eighteen,\n\n  \'turn over a new leaf (literally, to \'change my skin\').\n4 \'Because you\'re a man\'\nS For an analysis of La Cirimonie and of the fait divers in general. see Chapter 7.\n\f128    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nViolette poisoned both her parents, killing her father while her\nmother survived. In Chabrol\'s film, the crime is presented as a\nmystery, irreducible to the sodo-historical context or to individual\npsychology. Violette herself is a totally opaque and ambivalent\nfigure: was she a heartless, lying murderer, a greedy opportunist\nand a nymphomaniac, or a gullible young girl, duped by her\nboyfriend, and the victim - and avenger - of incestuous abuse by\nher father? As Chabrol\'s own voice· over reveals at the end of the\nfilm, the hysterical condemnation ofViolette during her trial, and\nher subsequent death sentence, were followed by clemency, a\nreduction in her sentence due to good behaviour, and ultimately\nby her release, a pardon, and an apparently conventional family\nlife as wife and mother. She thus came to represent what -\naccording to the surrealists\' interpretation, at least - she had tried\nto destroy: the normal, everyday petit bourgeois family. As the\nsensational trial and press coverage of 1934 made clear, the threat\nto the established order posed by Violette\'s crime could not be\ndismissed as originating in the working or supposedly \'criminal\'\nclasses. Instead, it \'came from within the very ranks of the respect-\nable classes and crystallized around the spectre offemale sexuality\nwithin the family\' (Walker 1995: 94).This recalls Chabrol\'s\ndepiction of sexual tensions, incest and murder within the petit\nbourgeois family in Blood Relatives (1978), the film he made imme-\ndiately before Violette Noziere. Indeed, the French title for that\nfilm, us Liens du sang, may have been suggested by one of the\nsurrealist poems written to celebrate the Noziere case: \'Violette a\nreve de defaire / A defait / L\'affreux nreud de serpents des liens du\nsang\'6 (ibid.: 98).\n    Chabrol\'s increasing concern with female characters as indivi-\nduals rather than as types or as embodiments of class is illustrated\nby the characterisation in Violette Noziere. Gone is the symbolic\nHelene role played by Stephane Audran (usually the personi-\nfication of the bourgeoisie, but also in La Rupture (1970) of the\n\n\n6 \'Violette dreamt of undoing I Undid I The hideous nest of snakes that is blood\n  relations\'. The poem is by Paul Eluard and was published in December 1933.\n  For more on Blood Relatives, see Chapter 4.\n\f                                                 STORIES OF WOMEN       129\n\n\nworking class). Now the female lead passes to Isabelle Huppert\nwho, as Violette, plays the first of several central roles in Chabrol\'s\nmore recent films. (Audran plays her mother Germaine and Jean\nCarmet her father Baptiste.) As Violette, Huppert portrays an\nultimately unknowable individual. The ambivalence of all human\npsychology (as Chabrol sees it) is paralleled in the film by the\ncompeting explanations for Violette\'s notorious crime. While the\nnarrative addresses the possible explanations - psychosexual,\nfinancial, moral, political- without reaching a defmitive conclusion,\nso too the camerawork and the editing appear to suggest answers,\nbut with the same result. The repeated close-ups on Violette\'s face\nand the flashbacks to her childhood suggest that we are going to\nlearn something concrete about her motives, but we never do. As\nshe tells the police, and as her impassive, mask-like make-up\nimplies, \'11 n\'y a rien acomprendre\') Violette and her crime have\nto be accepted but cannot be understood: she is as unfathomable\nas her pale, made-up face, as intangible as her ghost-like presence\nhovering in the night.\n   The tiny, constricted family flat is a recurrent metaphor for the\nnarrow horizons of the middle classes, the claustrophobic close-\nness of the family unit (also evoked in Blood Relatives), and the\npossibly incestuous proximity of Violette and her father. like\nEmma Bovary, Violette repeatedly dreams of an escape from her\nconfined life to broader, more romantic spaces. She tells her\nmanipulative boyfriend Jean (himself a downmarket version of\nCount Rodolphe just as Violette is a downmarket Emma Bovary)\nthat \'C\'est mesquin, s\'ennuyer, c\'est petit. Moi, j\'aime la grandeur\'.8\nAnd when her parents force Violette to write to Jean asking if he\nwill marry her, she calls them \'des nains\'.9 Although tiny, the\nNozieres\' flat is a place of many secrets: caches of money, letters\nand photographs are hidden all over the flat. The identity of\nViolette\'s real father (Monsieur Emile), her affair with Jean, her\nparents\' sexual activity, her father\'s desire for her and even the\nmurder itself are all poorly-hidden secrets which are stumbled\n\n7 \'There is nothing to understand\'\n8 \'Being bored is petty, it\'s small·minded. What I love is greatness\'\n9 \'dwarves\'\n\f130      ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\nupon in the confines of the family space. It is as if the brutal\n Freudian urges of the family - the jealous hoarding of money, the\nsearch for one\'s origins, the taboo desires of incest, the violent\nhatred of one\'s parents - cannot be repressed for long in such a\ntight space. The theme of repression is most brilliantly evoked\nwhen Violette appears to leave home after the discovery of her\naffair with Jean. The screen is split in half by a partition: on the\nright-hand side, her parents busy themselves tidying up and\nrestoring the \'normal\' family order; on the left-hand side, un-\nnoticed, Violette silently appears and stands in the doorway.\nApparently invisible to her parents, she is the \'abnormal\' spectre\nof the taboo desires that haunt the family and cannot be success-\nfully repressed. Although on this occasion she slips away again,\nher next intervention in the family space will be to attempt the\nmurder of her parents.\n    Before she commits her crime, Violette is associated more\nstrongly with fantasy than with action, as indeed are most of the\nfilm\'s characters. Where the men dream of power (either financial\nin the case of Jean, or political. in the case of the young Fascist\nseen at the start of the film), the women mostly dream of escape:\nViolette\'s friend Maddy of going to California; Violette of driving\nto the coast with Jean in a Bugatti sports car. Monsieur Emile\nappears at times to be less a real character than a fantasy of escape\ninto a higher social class, both for Germaine and for Violette. In\nthe restaurant scene where Violette begins to blackmail him,\nMonsieur Emile is in fact shot as ifhe were an image in her head:\nshe is shown in a facial close-up, with her real (or imagined?)\nfather\'s face hovering, reflected, in the mirror behind her.Io Most\nimages in the film of dreams and fantasies are, as here, mirrored\ncompositions. Numerous shots ofViolette show her staring at her\nreflection, as when she tells Maddy that \'Je veux qu\'on parle avec\ndes mots qui me fassent rever\'," or when she play-acts in front of\nthe mirror in her hotel room, kissing it and pretending it is an\nimage of Jean. Photographs also play a role in evoking fantasy. A\n\n10   Compare the composition at the hospital in Le Boucher, where the doctor\n     appears to spring from Helene\'s imagination.\nII   \'I want people to speak to me with words that will make me dream\'\n\f                                               STORIES OF WOMEN            131\n\n\nphoto of Lilian Gish, the great Hollywood actress of the silent era\n(associated with melodrama and with innocent suffering) is\npinned to the mirror in the hotel room. Ironically, although at this\nstage in the film Violette seems the polar opposite of this role\nmodel, by the end she has herself attained a kind of martyrdom.\nAnother photograph in the hotel room, showing waves crashing\non rocks, acts as a catalyst for Violette\'s romantic imaginings. It is\nfrom staring at this that she conjures up the image of Jean, in a\nprophetic dream, rising from the sea (like a male version of the\nmythical birth of beauty)." Hence also the recurrent dream of\ndriving to the sea with Jean, and his divine status in her eyes as a\nkind of romantic god (when he is in fact literally screwing her for\nmoney). In these dreams and above all her false image of Jean,\nViolette is revealed not as a violent monster but as a gullible and\nnaive young woman. (This image is again reversed, however, by\nher promiscuity where other men are concerned.)\n    The mirror images ofViolette act, like the contrasting glimpses\nof her personality throughout the narrative, to fragment our\npicture of her rather than to confirm it. Which is the real Violette?\nOr are we only seeing partial versions, reflections of different\naspects of her identity? Time and again the camera switches away\nfrom what we had supposed was Violette\'s \'real\' face to reveal that\nwe were looking at an image in the mirror. Our view of her is thus\nalways being revised. In the same manner, the flashbacks to her\nchildhood that punctuate the closing stages of the film qualify our\nimpression of Violette without ever proving definitive. They\nsimply add another layer to her mystery rather than peeling one\naway. Chabrol\'s attitude to Violette might be compared with\nViolette\'s to her (equally enigmatic) mother, of whom she says, \'Je\nl\'aime parce que je ne la comprends pas\'.Ij The final ironic twist is\nprovided by Violette\'s gradual change from guilt to innocence,\nfrom sickness and dirt (she is affiicted with syphilis) to purity,\nfrom the sexually-active, dirty and murderous \'red woman\' (an\nunwelcome spectre in the family home) to the rehabilitated,\n\n[2 According to classical mythology Venus, goddess of love and beauty, was born\n   from the waves.\n[3 \'I love her because I don\'t understand her\'\n\f132    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nfamily-oriented \'white woman\' (carer, wife and mother).I4\n    This development begins with the hospital sequence in which\nViolette, in her habitual black coat and hat, confronts two nurses\ndressed in white from head to foot. Both the mise en scene and the\nnarrative (Violette has just committed her crime; she is visiting\nher poisoned mother) underline the contrast between the sup-\nposedly good women and the supposedly evil one. But from this\npoint on, Violette becomes associated with innocence and selfless-\nness rather than guilt: she gives her watch to an old woman in the\nhospital corridor; she is betrayed to the police by a passer-by; at the\ntrial, she spares both her mother and Jean (by refusing to betray\nthe former\'s secret about Monsieur Emile or to incriminate the\nlatter in the theft of a ring). Finally, in prison, she becomes a\nsaintly figure: washing her cell-mate\'s feet (an allusion to Mary\nMagdalene), giving away her food and, in the last sequence,\nsinging while embroidering a white garment. (It is not just the\ncolour of the garment which is symbolic. The act of embroidery is\nassociated culturally with the \'white woman\' and, in the films of\nLuis Buftuel, with the dutiful bourgeois wife - see especially the\nending of Belle de jour (1967), another film about the potential\nrehabilitation of a \'red woman\' - in this case, a wife who turns to\nprostitution.) It is over yet another facial close-up ofViolette (this\ntime, devoid of her pale, mask-like make-up, and apparently at her\nmost real, natural and innocent), that Chabrol reads the closing\nvoice-over, in which the destroyer of the family is rehabilitated as a\nmodel wife and the mother of five children. The \'spectre of female\nsexuality\' has been domesticated once more. And - as in many of\nChabrol\'s films, including Juste avant la nuit (1971) and Nada\n(1974) - the threat to the status quo seems to have been absorbed\nand neutralised.\n\n\n\n\n14 The terms \'red woman\' and \'white woman\' are taken from Theweleit 1987. See\n   also the account of La Rupture in Chapter 3.\n\f                                                   STORIES OF WOMEN             133\n\n\nUne a/faire de femmes\n In many ways, Une affaire de femmes (1988) is a companion piece\nor sister fIlm to Violette Noziere - afait divers in which a woman is\nfound guilty of a crime against the family. Both women are played\nby Isabelle Huppert, and they share a certain naivety and an\nignorance of the ideological ramifications of their actions. Both\ncrimes are set against a background of political tensions (the rise\nof Fascism in the early 1930S; the German Occupation of France\nduring the Second world War). Une affaire de femmes could even\nbe considered the sequel to Violette Noziere, not just because\nembryonic Fascism has now developed into a fully-fledged Fascist\nstate - Vichy - but more precisely, because ten years separate both\nthe films (1978-88) and the real-life crimes they involve (1933-43).\n    Where the two films differ is in the importance of genre and of\npolitical history. Neither has a major role in structuring Violette\nNoziere (the film is about a murder case but is not a thriller;\nhistory and politics remain in the background and cannot explain\nthe case). Une affaire de femmes, by contrast, is essentially a melo-\ndrama\'S which ends up confronting the ideology of the period (as\nMarie herself has to do). In July 1943, Marie Bayon became the\nlast woman to be guillotined in France. Her crime was the illegal\npractice of abortion. Under the wartime Vichy regime, a crime\nagainst the family could be construed as a crime against the state.\nMarie is tried by the Tribunal de l\'Etat because abortion contra-\nvenes Vichy ideology, expressed in the motto Travail,famiUe, patrie.\'6\nThus the reasoning behind her execution, as Chabrol demonstrates,\nis political. She is made an example of because she contravenes\nthe Vichy model of the family (and the key role of the mother\nwithin it) as the cornerstone of the Fascist state. It is here that the\nfIlm\'s concerns with history and genre overlap: motherhood is the\n\n15 I would therefore disagree with Christian Blanchet\'s comment, in an otherwise\n   excellent account of the film, that there is no genre in Une affaire de femmes and\n   hence no distancing of the auteur from his subject (Blanche! 1989: 179).\n   However, the distancing effect of the melodrama is certainly transcended in the\n   closing stages concerning Marie\'s trial and execution.\n16 \'Work, Family, Country\'. Under Vichy, this replaced the Republican motto\n    Liberti, igaliti, fraterniti.\n\f134    CLAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n crux of the Vichy case against Marie, and of melodrama as a genre.\n It is perhaps natural, then, that Une affaire de femmes should be for\n the most part a maternal melodrama.\n     Maternal melodrama is most strongly associated with the\n \'weepie\' or \'woman\'s film\' made in Hollywood during the 1940s.\n In her study of the genre, Mary Anne Doane has defined melo-\n drama and the maternal as \'two discourses of the obvious\'.\n Melodrama makes it clear that \'Everyone has a mother, and further-\n more, all mothers are essentially the same, each possessing the\n undeniable quality of motherliness\' (Doane 1987: 70-1). This\n discourse of the obvious is identifiable in Chabrol\'s La Rupture\n (1970) which, as we have seen, concerns a good mother in her\n battle with her son\'s evil father-in-law. Although overlaid with\n strong political implications, La Rupture remains a straight\n melodrama, characterised by its moral absolutes, its obviousness\n and its \'will-to-transparency\' (ibid.: 71). Une affaire de femmes is a\n much less straightforward case, and as such is more characteristic\n of Chabrol\'s cinema in general. Here, the discourse is one of\n ambivalence rather than obviousness. This is because the generic\n conventions of maternal melodrama are complicated by two\n connected factors: the historical and political context, and the\nunstable, ambivalent status of motherhood in the film. There is\nnothing obvious about definitions of the mother in Une affaire de\nfemmes. Under Vichy, motherhood is a contested sign, an everyday\nreality subjected to an extreme political definition. Marie is\npunished for attacking that definition (albeit in ignorance of the\ndefinition itself) by her practice of abortion. What she perceives as\na favour or a helping hand for women \'in trouble\', the state\nperceives as an action against motherhood. But Marie is not just\nan abortionist - she is also a mother to her two young children,\nPierrot and Mouche. Moreover, as in the typical maternal melo-\ndrama, she brings up her children alone, without their father\'s\nhelp, and directs all of her efforts towards improving their quality\noflife. (One can easily compare Marie buying chocolate, jam and\nbiscuits for Pierrot and Mouche with the money from one of her\nfirst abortions with the similar scenes from the classical melo-\ndrama Mildred Pierce (1945), where Mildred buys piano and\n\f                                                   STORIES OF WOMEN              135\n\n\n dancing lessons for her daughters with the money she earns - also\n secretly - as a waitress.) So is Marie a good mother or not?\n     Within the generic code of the maternal melodrama, women\n are often punished for becoming bad mothers - usually for\n seeking a role outside the home. [7 In Mildred Pierce, for example,\n Mildred (Joan Crawford) begins the story as a good wife and a\n good mother. She is identified solely with child·rearing and\n domesticity: \'I was always in the kitchen. I felt as though I\'d been\n born in a kitchen, and lived there all my life, except for the few\n hours it took to get married. I married Sert when I was seventeen.\n I never knew any other kind of life - just cooking and washing and\nhaving children\'. This is the starting-point for her (ultimately\n dangerous and doomed) flirtation with life outside motherhood. It\n is also the starting-point for Marie\'s story and, as one of her clients\n makes clear, it is the reason why the abortions she provides are in\n demand. (Jasmine tells Marie that she has six children, that she\nhasn\'t been happy since she was sixteen, and that \'j\'ai l\'impression\nd\'etre une vache\'.)[8 This anti-maternal (and therefore anti-Vichy)\ndiscourse is expressed by Marie herself, symbolically in her\nactions as abortionist and independent woman, and verbally when\n she describes herself as more than just \'une petite femme au\nfoyer\'.[9 It is most explicit in the bitter mock-prayer she offers to\nthe Virgin Mary at the end of the mm: \'Je vous salue Marie, pleine\nde merde, le fruit de vos entrailles est pourri\'.20 In Mildred Pierce,\n Mildred\'s deviation from good motherhood (her divorce, her\nremarriage, her career in the restaurant business) is seen to bring\nabout her downfall: she loses both her daughters, her second\nhusband and her business. Similarly, Marie in Une affaire de\nfemmes is punished for moving out of the domestic and into the\nentrepreneurial realm. It is increasingly for herself rather than her\n\n17 The same is true of the representation of women in film noir. Mildred Pierce is in\n   many ways a hybrid offilm noir and melodrama.\n18 \') feel like a cow\'\n19 \'a little house·wife\'\n20 \'Hail Mary, full of shit, rotten is the fruit of your womb\'. Blanchet suggests that\n   this can be read two ways - as anti·Christian or as Christian - according to\n   whether the prayer is addressed to the Virgin or to Marie herself (Blanchet\n   1989: 183, n.2).\n\f136   ClAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nchildren that she wishes to move to bigger and better apartments\nand to have more money; she aspires to be a singer, and takes\nlessons; she starts an affair with a young collaborator while\nencouraging the maid to sleep with her husband; and she rents\nthe prostitute Lulu a room in which to bed her clients. Above all,\nshe expands her booming business as an abortionist. Marie\'s\nabortion business fulfils exactly the same function as Mildred\'s\nrestaurant business: originally a means of providing for their\nchildren, in time it becomes a kind of career, a means of economic\nindependence and self-definition away from the family home. It is\nfor this move away from the maternal role that both are punished.\n    But Marie\'s generic punishment as a bad mother (as decreed\nby the conventions of maternal melodrama) is doubled by her\npolitical punishment (her execution as decreed by the Vichy state).\nThis can be related back to her dual status as abortionist and as\nmother. The ideological weight of the former (under Vichy) is\nemphasised in the later stages of the film. But even in the earliest\nsequences, Marie\'s status as a good mother - and in particular her\nrelationship with her son Pierrot - is problematised. Pierrot (like\nhis father Paul) is consistently ignored or marginalised by Marie,\nwho favours her daughter Mouche. For all the celebration of\nfemale friendship and solidarity in the film (especially in Marie\'s\nrelations with Rachel and Lulu but also with her own daughter)\nthere remains the suggestion (again, typical of the maternal\nmelodrama) that Marie is de stabilising the family by marginal-\nising her weak husband and her neglected son. The patriarchal\npower structures which condemn her to death - from her own\nhusband, who denounces her to the police, to the male judges and\nalso Vichy itself, personified by its leader Marshal Petain - do so\nbecause she has sought to live outside male society and the roles it\nassigns to women. (It is also implicit that she is punished in order\nto make defeated France - symbolised by her husband Paul - feel\nstronger.) As Marie approaches her downfall in all innocence, at\nfirst it is only generic expectations that come into play. A growing\nsense of unease is linked to her dream of becoming a singer. Just\nwhen it seems as if she might be able to fulfil her ambition, her\nworld falls apart - as one would of course expect in a melodrama.\n\f                                                   STORIES OF WOMEN   137\n\nThus she is arrested on her return from a triumphant singing\nlesson. But there are also hints throughout the narrative at the\nexcessive (political) nature of Marie\'s fate. As she becomes ever\nmore daring in her affairs (both romantic and business), Chabrol\nimplies that the guillotine is awaiting her: hence the scene with\nthe decapitated goose, the death of the Resistance fighter in front\nof her, and Pierrot\'s strange (possibly prophetic) wish to become\nan executioner.\n    The final section of the film is introduced by a voice-over from\nthe adult Pierrot, looking back on his mother\'s death. This has the\neffect of mitigating the more reactionary implications that Une\naffaire de femmes shares with maternal melodrama. In other words,\nthe sense that Marie is being punished for neglecting her husband\nand son is qualified by her son\'s commentary. The harrowing\nprison sequences - culminating in the shocking execution - that\nfollow fulfil two key functions. Firstly, they satirise (in the blackest\nof tones, but with a touch of humour in the ludicrous rhetoric of\nthe trial judge) the hypocrisy and cruelty of the Vichy regime\n(which, as Marie\'s lawyer helpfully reminds us, deported Jewish\nchildren to their deaths while executing Marie for crimes against\nthe unborn). Secondly, they allow Chabrol to comment not just on\nthe cruelty of Marie\'s executioners but also, less explicitly, on the\ncruelty of the genre as well. The normal outcome of the maternal\nmelodrama has been exaggerated to the point of excess: Marie is\nexecuted for being a supposedly bad mother. And, as made clear\nin both the closing legend - \'Ayez pitie des enfants de ceux qu\'on\ncondamne\'" - and the film\'s most brutal scene (where Mouche\ncries out and Pierrot starts banging his head against the bedroom\nwall as Marie, sentenced to death, shakes uncontrollably in her\nprison cell), the mother-child relationship has been totally lost in\nthe equation.\n\n\n\n\n:oil   \'Have pity on the children of those condemned to death\'\n\f138     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nMadame Bovary\nBoth Une affaire de femmes and Les Innocents aux mains sales (1975)\nturn genres against themselves in their portrayal of women, expo-\nsing the cruelty that the melodrama directs against bad mothers\nand the film noir against the femme fatale by exaggerating the\npunishment the female characters ultimately undergo. But there\nis no such gap between generic conventions and their exploitation\nin Chabrol\'s heritage film Madame Bovary (1991). This is despite\nthe fact that Isabelle Huppert (who plays the lead once again) has\nidentified in Flaubert\'s original novel \'un petit decalage ... qui\njuxtapose le cliche et la critique du cliche\'\'\' (Boddaert et al. 1991:\n133). In truth, Chabrol\'s Madame Bovary does not distance itself\nfrom the cliches of the heritage genre in the way that, for example,\nYves Angelo\'s Balzac adaptation Le Colonel Chabert (1994) does!3\nHence Madame Bovary is characterised by fidelity to a literary\nsource, luscious costumes and decor, the depiction of public space\n(the town square) and reliance on set pieces (the ball, the wedding\nbanquet). It thus remains largely a genre piece, with little - except\nfor the dark humour - to distinguish it from French period dramas\nsuch as Claude Berri\'s Germinal (1993). The central theme of the\nfilm - female desire and its failure to find satisfaction in a\nclaustrophobic social environment - is expressed in several other\nfilms by Chabrol, from Les Bonnes Femmes to Une affaire de femmes\nand beyond. Emma Bovary\'s perpetual dissatisfaction at whatever\nfantasy she tries is even comparable to Jeanne Decourt in Que la\nbete meure (1969) - dabbling self-indulgently and unsuccessfully\nin painting, music, poetry, and eastern religion - and to HeUme\nescaping into yoga in Le Boucher (1969).\n   All of this raises the question of why Chabrol chose to film\nFlaubert\'s novel, and to add his adaptation to those of Jean Renoir\n(1934) and Vincente Minnelli (1949). He had planned the project\n\n2.2. \'a little shift, which juxtaposes the [romantic] cliche with the critique of the\n     cliche\'\n2.3 Angelo inverts the conventions of heritage camerawork by using slow and\n     graceful tracking shots to reveal impoverished and sordid - rather than wealthy\n     - surroundings. The film itself is about the dignity of poverty in the face of\n     hypocrisy and greed.\n\f                                              STORIES OF WOMEN           139\n\nfor years, but the deciding factor was the excellent working\nrelationship he built up with Isabelle Huppert on Violette Noziere\nand Une affaire de fommes. Without Huppert in the lead, Chabrol\nwould never have filmed this story of a country doctor\'s wife\nwhose romantic and financial escapades end in her suicide. By the\ntime he actually came to shoot Madame Bovary, Chabrol may also\nhave found that it chimed with the themes he had explored in his\nother films starring Huppert: the place of female desire, and the\npunishment of its expression. Isolated in a dull marriage, a small\nprovincial town and a bourgeois, male-dominated society, Emma\nBovary is always dependent on men for the satisfaction of her\ndesires - be it her prosaic husband Charles (Jean-Franr;ois Balmer)\nfor her family life, the comically down-to-earth priest for her\nspiritual longing, the cynical Monsieur Lheureux for her elegant\nwardrobe, or Count Rodolphe and the lawyer Leon for her sexual\npassion. Each, in his way - including her decent but limited\nhusband - fails her. In Huppert\'s words, \'C\'est de cela que meurt\nMadame Bovary: de ne pas avoir He reconnue comme une\npersonne desirante\'\'\'\' (ibid.: 126). Emma may be frustrated as a\ndesiring subject, but her desires are also represented as romantic\ncliches - unoriginaL fluctuating and at odds with reality. (Stereo-\ntypical romantic passion is mocked during the \'Cornices\' scene,\nwhen banal speeches and the mooing of cows from the agri-\ncultural show are heard as Emma swoons in Rodolphe\'s arms.)\nLike Marie in Une affaire de fommes, she is never satisfied with\nwhat she has: hence the scenes in both films where the purchase\nof a new house promises the start of a new chapter in the heroine\'s\nlife, only for the novelty to quickly wear off. But unlike Marie,\nEmma cannot express her desires through independent or\nentrepreneurial action, only through the cultural stereotypes she\nhas learned from her reading (romantic heroine) or her upbring-\ning (dutiful wife and mother). It is between these two poles -\nwhich we may term the \'red woman\' and the \'white woman\'\n(Theweleit 1987) - that Emma oscillates with increasing despera-\ntion in her search for an authentic and fulfilling identity.\n24 ·That"s what Madame Bovary dies of - not being recognised as a person with\n   desires·\n\f140     ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\n    Emma\'s fragmented sense of identity is comparable to\nViolette\'s in Violette Noziere. Her desires - like Violette\'s - are\nrepeatedly signalled by mirror images. Mirrors might be said to\nrepresent Emma\'s ideal self, her fantasy of herself through the\nlooking-glass. They are associated with her romantic experiences:\nhence the mirrored compositions of her and the vicomte after they\nwaltz together, and the almost identical post-coital mirror images\nof her with Rodolphe and with Leon. The most revealing example\nof this kind of shot comes in Emma\'s first private conversation\nwith the haberdasher Lheureux. In a composition reminiscent of\nthe restaurant scene in Violette Noziere - where Monsieur Emile\nappears reflected above Violette\'s head - Emma faces towards the\ncamera as she speaks to Lheureux (off-screen). On the wall behind\nher a mirror shows the reflection of her own head. Also visible in\nthe mirror (but not outside it) are the shiny dresses that Lheureux\nis trying to tempt Emma into buying. The effect of the framing\nhere is to suggest that in the realm of her own fantasy - the\nlooking-glass - Emma is captivated by the dresses and the elegant\nlifestyle that they evoke. But for once she repudiates her romantic\nfantasies and declares \'Je n\'ai besoin de rien\'.\'! When Lheureux\nhas left, Emma turns to the mirror and tells her fantasy self\n\'Comme j\'ai ete sage\'.,6 For the moment, the spectre of the\nromantic \'red woman\' has been kept at bay. In her final meeting\nwith Rodolphe, to ask him to payoff her debts, Emma is again\nframed in a mirror. This time, the \'red woman\' is in full sway.\nEmma has in fact recreated her passionate image - wearing a\nblack dress and red lipstick\'7 - from the time of her affair with\nRodolphe, in order to persuade him to perpetuate her fantasy\nexistence and to payoff the demands of reality. (After all, romantic\nimages have worked this magic before in the film. The picture of a\nball on the wall of the Bovarys\' first house functions in this way:\nthe image precedes the reality, and appears to summon it up.\nImmediately after Emma has gazed wistfully at the picture,\nCharles announces that they have been invited to a ball at the\n\n25 \'I don\'t need anything\'\n26 \'Wasn\'t 1 good?\'\n27 This is also the image recreated on the film poster.\n\f                                        STORIES OF WOMEN        141\n\n\nchateau.) But her attempt fails. The gestures and swoons she\npractised in the garden earlier now become frantically genuine,\nand culminate in her impulsive suicide.\n    Colour functions symbolically throughout Madame Bovary -\nalthough this can be related not just to Chabrol\'s expressionism,\nbut to other heritage films, such as Alain Corneau\'s Tous les matins\ndu monde (1992), which contrasts warm reds with cold blues.\nChabrol similarly evokes the emotional connotations of red and\nblue in Madame Bovary. Hence red dominates in the scenes of\nEmma\'s affairs - her dresses and lipstick, and also the decor of\nRodolphe\'s chateau and of Leon\'s rooms in Rouen. Red is also\nused - as Hitchcock uses it in Marnie (1964) - to express the pro-\ntagonist\'s state of mind at a moment of crisis. Where Hitchcock\nshows Marnie, after she has had to shoot her injured horse,\nagainst a background of red carpets and walls (suggesting blood\nbut also \'seeing red\' and a loss of all self-control), so Chabrol\nshows Emma against a bright red background as Rodolphe tells\nher he has no money and she realises there is no way out. Blue,\nmeanwhile, is used to signify the threat of death - as it does for\ninstance in Les Biches (1967), La Rupture (1970) and Une partie de\nplaisir (1975). Emma\'s suicide is bathed in blue - from the decor\nand lighting of the pharmacy where she swallows arsenic to the\ncolour of her bed and even of the dark liquid that she vomits at the\nmoment of death. But colour in Madame Bovary also has a cultural\nsignificance relating to stereotypes of female behaviour, according\nto which, as we have hinted, red is contrasted with white.\n    Red signifies female sexuality encoded as a threat, as illicit\npassion (the \'fallen woman\' or the \'scarlet woman\'). White, on the\nother hand, denotes the \'white woman\', the good wife and mother,\nthe carer - desexualised and domesticated. Emma switches between\nthese two roles in her attempt to define herself, and the mise en\nscene emphasises the dichotomy. Red - with black - dominates the\ndecor and Emma\'s costume during her planned elopement with\nRodolphe, her liaisons with Leon and, as we have seen, her final\nattempt to raise some money. But these phases as the \'red woman\'\nalternate with sudden periods of repentance, in which Emma\nassumes a dutiful family role. While she is playing the good wife\n\f142    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nand mother - attending to her little daughter Berthe, encouraging\nCharles to be ambitious, even sewing on his buttons - her clothes\nand the surrounding decor are invariably white or an associated\npale colour (cream, grey, light green). But when this fantasy\nwanes, as when Charles\'s misconceived operation on a club-foot\ngoes horribly wrong, Emma reverts to her role as scarlet woman -\nin this case resuming her affair with Rodolphe the same night,\nand appearing incongruously at breakfast next morning (beside\nthe drab Charles and his aged mother) in a splendid red dress. In\na sense, it is her inability to keep the two mutually exclusive roles\napart (with the \'red woman\' visibly invading the pale domestic\nspace more and more frequently) which precipitates her death.\n    The patriarchal society she inhabits can also be implicated in\nEmma\' s death - but Chabrol makes no attempt to emphasise a\nfeminist reading of the film. This is due to his desire to remain\nabsolutely faithful to Flaubert and to refrain from introducing a\n(conscious) twentieth-century perspective in the film. It remains\nclear, however, that Emma\'s dissatisfaction stems in part from the\nconstraint she is under, as a woman, to conform to one or other of\na very limited number of roles. She cannot see beyond those roles,\nbut nor is she encouraged to do so by the men who surround her.\nEmma is also inhibited by her social status. Like Violette;8 she is\nconstricted emotionally and physically by her middle-class sur-\nroundings: hence the small, drab home she shares with Charles,\nand especially the cramped dining room (which is juxtaposed\nregularly with wider spaces like the chateau where the ball takes\nplace, or the fields and woods where she goes riding with Rodolphe).\nWhile Emma dies within these social restrictions, and Violette is\nfinally recuperated into them, the contemporary protagonist of\nBetty (1992) frees herself and is able to simply exist outside them\n(in a way that a nineteenth-century woman like Emma could not).\nOnly in the world of the grande bourgeoisie (a vestige of the\nnineteenth century) does Betty suffer the identity crisis that\nEmma suffers throughout her life.\n\n28 The parallel is emphasised when Violette\'s parents suggest that she should\n   marry a middle-class professional- a chemist (like Homais in Madame Bovary)\n   or a doctor (like Charles Bovary).\n\f                                               STORIES OF WOMEN           143\n\n8etty\n\n Betty (1992), like Madame Bovary, is a faithful adaptation of a\nnovel, telling the story of an unsatisfied young woman who seeks\nto define herself outside the social and familial roles offered her.\nBut there are three crucial differences. Firstly, the film escapes\neasy definition as a genre piece: its likeliest description is as a\npsychological drama, but it is resolutely anti-psychological (we are\ngiven questions about the characters, not answers), while the only\ndramatic event, as Chabrol admits, is \'la signature du papier"9\n(Jousse and Toubiana 1992: 31). Secondly, unlike Emma in Madame\n Bovary (and Marie in Une affaire de femmes), Betty triumphantly\nsurvives: \'C\'est la revanche de Madame Bovary, sa triomphe\nfinale. Si Emma avait ete comme Betty, elle s\'en serait tiree\'3               0\n\n\n(ibid.). And thirdly, this is undoubtedly one ofChabrol\'s best fums.\n    Betty is Chabrol\'s second adaptation from Georges Simenon,\nfollowing Les Fantomes du chapelier in 1982. Even more so than\nBalzac, Simenon is a novelist who bears close comparison with\nChabroI, and with whom he identifies (Chabrol 1976: 348). They\nshare a prolific output (Simenon wrote over two hundred novels,\nincluding seventy Maigret stories), an interest in criminal and\nanti-social behaviour, and a detached perspective. Chabrol\'s objec-\ntive camerawork, like Simenon\'s neutral writing style, presents\ncase studies of human action without making any moral judge-\nments. Betty follows a young woman (Marie Trintignant) on a\ndrunken binge from which she is apparently rescued by an\nenigmatic mother figure, Laure (Stephane Audran).3\' Betty slowly\nreveals to Laure how she married into the grande bourgeoisie, but\nwas driven out and forced to sign away her rights to see her two\ndaughters when her numerous affairs were discovered. Sticking\nclosely to the structure and the dialogue of the source novel,\nChabrol\'s film is fragmented, shifting backwards and forwards\n\n29 \'the signing of the paper\'\n30 \'It\'s the revenge of Madame Bovary, it\'s her final triumph. If Emma had been\n   like Betty, she would have escaped\'\n31 Chabrol comments on the fact that Stephane Audran could almost have been\n   Marie Trintignant\'s mother in real life, since Audran\'s first husband was\n   Marie\'s father, Jean·Louis Trintignant (Jousse and Toubiana 199 2 : 34).\n\f144   CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nbetween the present and the past. There is however no sense of\ndeliberate formal patterning here - as there is, say, in A double tour\n (I959) or us Bonnes Femmes (I960). The flashbacks, which include\nrepeated glimpses ofBetty\'s signing away of her children, and - in\na flashback within a flashback - a Freudian \'primal scene\' in\nwhich she sees her uncle having sex with the maid, are all subjec-\ntive and, so to speak, organic. They develop from Betty\'s present\nsituation and state of mind. In this regard they are closer to the\nfluid temporality of stream of consciousness than to the usual role\nof flashbacks in cinema - to explain the present by reference to the\npast. The flashbacks are traditionally anchored by close-ups of\nBetty\'s face, but they are motivated not by any narrative function\nso much as by Betty\'s own inability to follow the thread of the\npresent conversation. Bored and drunk, she claims to be listening\nto Laure, and in fact we often continue to hear Laure\'s voice\ndroning on in the background, as images from the past drift into\nBetty\'s mind and onto the screen. Even when the central enigma\nin the film is resolved - how and why has Betty got into the state\nshe\'s in at the start? - a second is posed regarding her relationship\nwith Laure and with the latter\'s boyfriend, Mario. It is no coinci-\ndence that the film ends with a close-up on Betty\'s mysterious\nsmile, shot through the misty waters of an aquarium. Like the\nHelE~nes of La Femme infidele, Le Boucher and Juste avant la nuit\n(played of course by Stephane Audran), she remains obscure.\n    The close-ups on Marie Trintignant\'s face throughout the film\n- like the flashbacks - invert their conventional role in cinema.\nWhere flashbacks are meant to explain, here they complicate\nmatters. (For instance, does the scene between her uncle and the\nmaid really explain Betty\'s promiscuity? Or is it a red herring, or at\nthe most, simply one stage in the development of her sexuality?)\nWhere facial close-ups on an actress are usually associated with\nsacred beauty or eroticism, here they reveal Betty as ravaged,\nexhausted and drunk, seemingly mechanical in her indifference\nto everything except ordering the next whisky. (The unsparing\nphotography is not limited to Trintignant: Stephane Audran\ncomplained that the chief cameraman had ruined her appearance\nthroughout the film.) Like Violette, Betty is presented as fragmented,\n\f                                                  STORIES OF WOMEN      145\n\n\nirreducible to one single reading. She is always seen from the\noutside (hence the opening credit sequence where we watch\nthrough a window as she drinks in a bar), even if the flashbacks\nare subjective. Again as in Violette Noziere, the camera pans back\nfrom an apparently real image of the protagonist\'s face to reveal it\nas a reflection in the mirror. This raises questions of how Betty\'s\nidentity is defined.\n    The dual nature ofBetty\'s identity makes the film one ofChabrol\'s\nmost incisive comments on the position of women in a male-\ndominated society. (A position which is - again - exacerbated by\nsocial class: Betty is a lower-class woman in a male-dominated and\nbourgeois-dominated society.) \'Betty\' is the protagonist\'S natural\nself anti-social, alcoholic and fascinated by sex. \'Elisabeth\' is her\nartificial self: a culturally defined identity as bourgeois wife and\nmother, socialised and subservient. Even more than the loss of her\ntwo small daughters and her expulsion from the bourgeoisie, it is\nthe traumatic collision of these two identities which is dramatised\nin the scene of the paper-signing - the narrative crux of the film,\nto which we are returned again and again by Betty\'s remembering\nof it. As the first flashback reveals, Betty originally signs the paper\n\'Betty\', but this is spotted by her mother-in-law (the personifi-\ncation of the grande bourgeoisie and a character who only ever\nrefers to Betty as Elisabeth). Corrected by the lawyer, Betty signs as\n\'Elisabeth Etamble\', giving her maiden name, age, (lack of) pro-\nfession and so on. That this is felt as some kind of betrayal of her\nreal self is evident from her account of the event. In her drunken\nmisery at the memory of what she has done, she sobs that she has\nsold her children, and also that Tai marque "Elisabeth" au lieu de\n"Betty", et puis j\'ai pris un cheque\')\' It is not just her daughters\nthat Betty has sold, but her own identity. Viewed in this light, the\nspiral of drinking and casual sex which follows the signing of the\npaper is Betty\'s means of reasserting her identity, and an act of\ndefiance against the legalistic and reductive definition of her\nrecorded in the document. The first proof of this comes when she\nsigns to have her belongings transferred to Laure\'s hotel in\nVersailles: in a reversal of the document scene, she begins to write\n32 \'I put "Elisabeth" instead of "Betty", and then I took the cheque\'\n\f146     ClAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n\'Elisabeth\', but changes the \'E\' to a \'B\' and signs as \'Betty\'. The\nfinal proof - as we shall see shortly - is her betrayal of Laure and\nher running off with Mario.\n    If sex and alcohol characterise Betty\'s natural behaviour, then\nmarriage and motherhood characterise her culturally acquired\nidentity. Flashbacks to her bourgeois existence with Guy Etamble\nand his insufferable mother reveal the extent to which she is\nrequired to deny her true personality and to become - like Jasmine\nin Une affaire de femmes - little more than a womb. Her role is to\nprovide children but she is also, paradoxically, denied the chance\nto rear them - that is the nanny\'s job. As in La Muette (1965) and\nLa Rupture (1970), it is the coldness of the bourgeois family that\nChabrol satirises most violently. In a scene added to the original\nnovel, Chabrol contrasts the marginalisation of Betty\'s children by\nthe Etambles - they are brought in to say goodnight but not allowed\nto spend even five minutes with their mother - with a television\ngameshow watched by Madame Etamble, in which the contestant\nwarmly declares, Tembrasse toute me famille - ma femme, mes\nenfants .. .\'JJ Betty is also confronted with the bourgeoisie in the\nslightly seedy form of Laure. There is a kind of doubling here, in\nwhich Laure is an older version of Elisabeth (Betty\'s bourgeois\nself). Like Debbie and Bertha in Lang\'s The Big Heat (1953), they\nare \'sisters under the mink\'. During the long sequences in Laure\'s\nhotel room, the two women tell each other about their past - each\nusing exactly the same form of words to assure the other that they\nreally are listening when they are not. Like Betty, Laure has tried to\ndrown a previous existence as a bourgeois wife in an alcoholic\nbinge. But whereas Betty never felt that she belonged to bourgeois\nsociety (\'le ne pouvais pas etre comme eux\'),J4 and precipitated her\nown expulsion from it (she is discovered having sex with her lover\nin the middle of the drawing-room), Laure was a willing partici-\npant: \'Mon univers, c\'etait mon mari, ma maison\'.l5 Laure regrets\n\n33 \'I send my love to all the family - my wife, my children .. : With typical malice,\n   Chabrol has Madame Etamble suddenly fall asleep in front of the television, as if\n   struck dead by a heart attack.\n34 \'I couldn\'t be like them\'\n35 \'My world was my husband and my house\'\n\f                                                 STORIES OF WOMEN            147\n\n\nher husband\'s death, her isolation from the bourgeoisie and her\nnew, rootless status. She is lost without a social role to fulfil (hence\nperhaps her mothering of Betty). She therefore represents what\nBetty risks becoming if the latter fails to reassert her true, anti-\nsocial and anti-bourgeois identity. This identity is characterised by\nher survival instinct and her sex drive, which allow her to\novercome the falsity of her bourgeois life and eventually Laure\'s\nclaustrophobic maternal attentions. Rather than the female\nsolidarity of Une affaire de ftmmes, the relationship between Betty\nand Laure is reminiscent of the power struggles between Charles\nand Paul in the Heiene cycle (with Mario the object of desire and\nexchange). Betty wins, and Laure goes away to die. The final line of\nthe film, read by Chabrol, declares that \'Laure Lavancher en\ndefinitive etait morte parce que Betty avait survecu. C\'etait l\'une\nou l\'autre, et Betty avait gagne\')6 But it is also Elisabeth - the\ntamed, civilised and constrained bourgeois self, the subservient\nwife and mother - who has died, allowing Betty\'s true self to\nsurvive.\n    If female sexuality is spectral in Violette Noziere and illicit in\nMadame Bovary, in Betty it is unclean. Betty is portrayed as dirty\n(in both senses) throughout the film: at school she has to write on\nthe blackboard \'Je suis une petite sale\';l7 when she meets Guy for\nthe first time, she spills coffee all over his clean suit; later he tells\nher \'C\'est efface\'l8 when she confesses to a promiscuous past. As\nshe herself says, \'J\'ai passe ma vie a salir\')9 This complies with the\nconventional, patriarchal representation of sexually active women\n(particularly those from the lower classes, like Betty) as unclean:\n\'the bodies of erotic women, especially proletarian ones, become\nso much wet dirt\' (Theweleit 1987: 421). But Betty\'s sexuality is\nnot condemned in the film so much as celebrated - as an affront\nto prudish bourgeois manners and as a defining fact of her own\nexistence. (Chabrol himself is fond of metaphors - like \'getting\n\n36 \'Ultimately, Laure Lavancher had died because Betty had survived. It was one or\n   the other, and Betty had won\'\n37 \'[ am a filthy little girl\'\n38 \'It\'s wiped clean\'\n39 \'I dirty everything [ touch\'\n\f148    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nyour hands dirty\' - which link life with dirt.) The Etambles perceive\n8etty as a sexual threat, and try to redefine her as a desexualised\nwife and mother - the \'white woman\'. But her sexuality cannot be\nrepressed. The white suit she wears on the day she signs the\ndocument becomes crumpled and stained in the bars and hotel\nrooms she visits later that night. In the final triumphant scene -\nwhen she has escaped with Mario to his suggestively named\nrestaurant Le Trou4° - she wears black, with red lipstick. As the\ncredits roll, a final close-up on her face centres on the sexual\nsymbol of her bright red mouth. Where Emma Bovary\'s \'red\nwoman\' fantasy of eloping with Rodolphe fails, Betty\'s elopement\nwith Mario succeeds. (The parallel is emphasised by the mise en\nscene: both women wear black with red lipstick in the climactic\nscenes.) Alternatively, like Laura in Juste avant la nuit (1971) -\nanother sexually voracious woman associated with dirt - Betty has\nbeen expelled from the apparently spotless bourgeoisie, but where\nLaura is killed (and her murder effaced), 8etty survives, resolutely\nsexual and anti-social to the last.\n\nPopular film genres seem to entail the punishment of the\nsexualised woman: hence the fate of the femme fatale in film noir\n(Julie in Les Innocents aux mains sales) and the bad mother in\nmelodrama (Marie in Une affaire de femmes). Chabrol, as we have\nseen, is fully aware of this convention and fore grounds it through\nexaggeration. His adaptation of Madame Bovary elaborates the\nmain theme - women punished for having desires - of the genre\npieces just mentioned. The case with Violette Noziere and Betty is\ncomplicated, however, by the fact that these are not genre films\n(they are only distantly related to the thriller). 80th avoid the brutal\nclosure of the others, and allow their eponymous heroines to\nsurvive beyond the last frame. lfin Violette Noziere this survival is\nat the price of a rehabilitation into the conventionally feminised\nspace of domesticity, in Betty the situation is reversed: Betty has to\nleave her children behind along with the unreal upper-class world\nof the Etambles family. If it thus seems impossible for the women\nin these films to have their cake and eat it (to have a family and a\n40 The Hole\n\f                                                    STORIES OF WOMEN              149\n\n\nsexualised, independent identity), this is largely because of the\ndetermining influence of social class (bourgeois codes of morality\nin Madame Bovary and Betty) and of patriarchy (the male jurors\ncursed by Violette, the Vichy state which condemns Marie). (It\nmight also be noted that all four films end with the voice of a male\nnarrator: Chabrol in Violette Noziere; Chabrol again, reading\nSimenon, in Betty; Marie\'s son Pierrot in Une affaire de femmes;\nand Fran<;ois Perrier reading Flaubert in Madame Bovary.) None\nthe less, the spirit of dissatisfaction and rebellion incarnated at\nleast temporarily by Violette and Emma, and almost incessantly by\nMarie and Betty, remains - to be given a further, defiantly Marxist,\ntwist in La Ceremonie (1995).\n\n\n\nReferences\nBerthomieu, P., Jeancolas.

Described by Cahiers du cinema as\n\'le plus grand film du cinema fran~ais depuis longtemps" (Strauss\n1995: 26), it finally confirmed his long, slow rehabilitation by the\nintellectual strand of the French film press. In contrast with the\ncritical reception in France for much of Chabrol\'s work from the\n1960s, the 1970S and even the early 1980s, he was now con-\nsidered \'le plus moderne de tous les auteurs issus de la Nouvelle\nVague" (Jousse 1995: 35), and possibly the greatest French film-\nmaker ever) Although this reassessment involved a very brief\nglance back at his earlier films, it was principally on the evidence\nof La Ceremonie that Chabrol was adjudged to be a master at work.\n    Based on a Ruth Rendell crime novel that Chabrol updated and\nmodified (adding in particular an emphasis on television which\nwas absent from the book), the film relates the gradual tensions\nthat surface in the power relations between a wealthy bourgeois\nfamily, the Lelievres, and their new maid Sophie (Sandrine Bon-\nnaire). The two catalysts for the bloody finale, in which the family\nare shot dead in cold blood, are Sophie\'s sense of powerlessness -\nexacerbated and symbolised by her inability to read - and her\n\n I   \'the greatest French film for a long time\'\n 2   \'the most modern of all the auteurs to come out of the new wave\'\n     See the editorial of Cahiers du cinema 494. p. 22.

The film thus functions both as a\nthriller and, in a political sense, as an illustration of the class war\nwhich Chabrol continues to observe in French society. But not\nonly is La Ceremonie a masterful film in its own right, it can also be\nseen as a compendium of some of the motifs that characterise\nChabrol\'s work as a whole. It is in attending to these motifs that\nwe can come to a conclusion regarding Chabrol\'s long-disputed\nstatus as an auteur in French cinema.\n\n\n\nThe fait divers\n\nWe have already seen how real-life crime stories or faits divers are\nreflected in several of Chabrol\'s films, from Les Bonnes Femmes\nand Les Noces rouges to Violette Noziere and Une affaire de femmes.\nThis is also true, to an extent, of La Ceremonie, which is partly\nanalogous to the infamous case of the Papin sisters. In I933, a year\nbefore the equally notorious crime committed by Violette Noziere,\nthe Papins, both maids, butchered their mistress and her\ndaughter. The trial that followed drew a huge amount of attention\nfrom the public and the media, and gave rise to two distinct inter-\npretations of the crime. As with Violette Noziere, the surrealists\ninterpreted the Papin case politically - as a direct attack on the\nbourgeoisie by its very own servants. But according to psychia-\ntrists, the crime was psychological rather than political, and was in\na sense committed not by both sisters but by a bizarre and paranoid\n\'third person\' who they became under stress (Walker I995: 94).\nAlthough no direct reference is made to the Papin case in La\nCeremonie, it influenced Chabrol\'s co-writer Caroline Eliacheff in\nher reworking of the source novel (Guerin and Jousse I995: 30).\nThe result is a certain emphasis on the fusion of identities\nbetween Sophie and Jeanne as if, like the Papin sisters, they were\nturning into a murderous third person. This process begins when\nSophie visits Jeanne\'s flat and they discover that they have a\nsimilar past (Sophie was implicated in the death of her father,\nJeanne in the death of her daughter). Beyond this shared guilt\n\f152    CLAUOE CHABROL\n\n\n(even before the shared murder) there is a sense of shared identity\nas the two sit watching Sophie\'s television, arm in arm, with their\nhair in pigtails and vacant expressions on their faces. And the\nprocess is completed in the murder sequence, during which their\ngestures (whether drinking coffee in the kitchen as they reload or\nbearing down on Gilles in the doorway of the drawing-room) are\nidentical and simultaneous. Much more so than Betty and Laure\n(Betty) , or even Why and Frederique (Les Biches), Sophie and\nJeanne are at this point one and the same.\n    But if La Cirimonie is in part a version of the Papin case, it does\nnot privilege the psychological reading over the political one, in\nthe way that Nancy Meckler\'s Sister My Sister (UK, 1994) does.\nFrom the opening credits (showing two little girls combing each\nother\'s hair) to the final shot (the two sisters clinging to each other\nin bed, their hair wild and their faces haggard),4 Meckler\'s film\nfocuses on the psychotic and ultimately incestuous closeness\nbetween the two maids. Chabrol, on the other hand, avoids any\nsustained or direct psychological explanation for the murder of\nthe Lelievres. This allows him to maintain a sense of the opacity of\nhuman motives and to introduce a possible political interpretation\nof the killing. It is impossible to say whether Sophie and Jeanne\ncommit the murders in order to avenge personal humiliations\n(Melinda discovering that Sophie cannot read, Monsieur Lelievre\naccusing Jeanne of opening his mail), or to reverse power\nrelations between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.\n   Above and beyond individual cases, the fait divers as a form can\nbe usefully compared to Chabrol\'s cinema in general. The fait\ndivers \'speaks of scandal, sensation, disruption of the norm\', events\nthat \'the dominant ideology cannot accommodate ... properly\'\n(Walker 1995: 1-2). It is precisely such disruptions that interest\nChabrol, especially insofar as they challenge accepted morality,\nwhich he calls \'Une regIe de jeu qui arrange une classe domin-\nante\'S (Chabrol 1976: 53). In his films, the \'disruption of the norm\'\n\n4 This is a recreation of the famous photograph of the Papin sisters after the\n  murder, published in 1933 in the magazines Ditective and Le Surrialisme au\n  service de la revolution.\n5 \'The rules of a game that suits the dominant class\'\n\f                                       MASTER OF CEREMONIE           153\n\n\nmost often takes the form of an intrusion into the enclosed and\nself-satisfied world of the bourgeoisie, and typically either begins\nUuste avant la nuit) or ends (L\'(EU du malin, Les Biches, La Femme\ninfidele, La Cirimonie) with murder. What makes the latter case so\nshocking is the extent to which the victims of the murder are\nnormalised. Unlike, say, the corrupt and buffoonish Paul in Les\nNoces rouges, the claustrophobic and incestuous families in Blood\nRelatives and Violette Noziere, or the Fascistic Vichy regime in Une\naffaire de femmes, the Lelievre family are unobjectionable. Their\nonly fault is in fact simply their function - as Sophie\'s employers,\nand as the embodiment of the bourgeoisie. They represent the\nmasters, the norm, the \'dominant ideology\', and it is as such that\nthey are destroyed.\n    The potentially subversive effects of the fait divers are usually\nmitigated by its position, literally at the margins of journalism.\nThus the fait divers in fact works to neutralise threats against the\nnorm:\n   the rubric of the fait divers has a dual function: on the one hand, by\n   reporting odd or bizarre items, it seeks to translate them into the\n   language of common concerns; but, because of its secondary\n   status. it marginalizes such items, keeps them at a safe remove\n   from the centre of society. The fait-diversier thus lays claim to the\n   off-beat or grotesque on behalf of bourgeois humanism or\n   conventional society. (Walker 1995: 2)\n    Chabrol\'s cinema carries out the first function but not the\nsecond. It translates the violent, the inexplicable and the grotesque\n- be it revolution (Les Biches) , terrorism (Nada), freak accidents\n(Les Cousins, La Muette, Que la bete meure) murder (numerous\nfilms from A double tour to La Cirimonie) or suicide (Le Cri du\nhibou, Dr M, Madame Bovary) - into \'the language of common\nconcerns\' by filming these events in the guise of popular genres,\nnotably the thriller. But because genre cinema is at the centre and\nnot at the margins, Chabrol\'s work does not marginalise its\nnarratives in the way that the fait divers, or indeed art cinema,\ndoes. At least after his new-wave period, Chabrol deliberately uses\nrecognisable genres and classical realism in order to aim his work\nat \'the centre of society\'. (So successful was he in this respect that\n\f154     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n during the late 1960s and early 1970S he was equated with \'the\ncentre\' by radical film critics.) This approach allows him to\nundermine rather than defend \'bourgeois humanism\'. It should\nalso be noted that Chabrol works largely in realist film genres (the\nthriller, the melodrama, the war film, the period drama). Only one\nof his films can be classified as fantasy cinema (Alice ou la demiere\nfugue), and while the vampire movie informs part of Les Biches, he\nhas never made a horror film or a science fiction film. (This\ncontrasts with his new-wave colleagues, Godard and Truffaut,\nwho made Alphaville and Fahrenheit 451 respectively.) The reason\nfor this may be the marginal status traditionally accorded to\nfantasy genres in France. By sticking to the thriller and other realist\ngenres, Chabrol has managed to maintain a subversive position\nwithin the mainstream.\n\n\n\nClass war\nPolitically as well as aesthetically, Chabrol is interested in\nbringing the margins to the centre. In the late 1970S he predicted\nthat \'the real center will be a sort of modern Marxism\' (Yakir 1979:\n9). Even if by the early 1990S events seemed to have proved him\nwrong - with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of\ncommunism - he was still prepared to make what he half-jokingly\ncalled \'le dernier film marxiste\'6 (Guerin and Taboulay 199T 68).\nLa Ceremonie fulfils this function by virtue of the importance of\nclass struggle within the film.7 Hence the destruction of the\nbourgeois Lelievre family by the working·class pairing of Sophie\nand Jeanne. In this respect, the generally blameless behaviour of\nthe Lelievres is crucial. Their best efforts to treat Sophie correctly\nare doomed to failure because they fail to accept her as she is\n(unable to read) and they also fail, politically speaking, to frame\n\n 6 \'the last Marxist film\'\n 7 To a certain degree, the film also reflects concerns about current tensions in\n   French society. Chabrol has said that La Cirimonie predicts an imminent implo-\n   sion while Mathieu Kassovitz\'s La Haine (also 1995) predicts an imminent\n   explosion. See Berthomieu et al. 1995: 9.\n\f                                            MASTER OF CEREMONIE              155\n\n\ntheir efforts in any other form than that of master-servant\nrelations. Thus Melinda, who tries hardest to be fair to Sophie, cannot\nhelp ordering her about even when they are supposed to be having\na cup of tea together. (She also offends Jeanne with her superior\nknowledge and her superior manner.) The family are therefore\nkilled not because of their personalities (which are sympathetic),\nbut because of their class. As Chabrol says, \'[la famille bourgeoise)\nn\'est attaquable que par son etat, c\'est s;a le marxisme\'8 (Guerin\nand Jousse 1995: 28). Sophie is not in the slightest ideologically\naware, while Jeanne\'s resentment confuses the political with the\npersonal, but that does not prevent their actions -like those of the\nPapin sisters - from being represented or interpreted as class war.\n    In contrast with the bourgeois families of La Muette, Les Noces\nrouges and Folies bourgeoises, the Lelievres are not subjected to\nridicule by means of farce. Nor are they subjected to the half-ideal-\nised, half-satirical perspective of the Helene cycle. Consequently\nLa Cirimonie is Chabrol\'s most direct representation of class\nstruggle. This is a matter of setting as well as characterisation.\nWhere Les Biches concerns personal relations as a metaphor for\nrevolution, La Rupture depicts a class-based custody battle and\nNada a political kidnapping, La Cirimonie alone concerns social\nrelations in the workplace. 9 That the workplace happens to be the\nLelievres\' family home only serves to emphasise the gulf between\nthe bourgeoisie and the working-classes. For while the Lelievres\nepitomise the bourgeois family, Sophie and Jeanne - both solitary,\nboth associated with the death of a family member - reflect what\nMarx calls \'the practical absence of the family among the prole-\ntarians\' (Marx and Engels [1848) (1953): 74). La Cirimonie thus\nmakes explicit what is implicit in Chabrol\'s work as a whole - the\nabsence of the working-class family.\n    In the bourgeois home, Sophie is taught to know her place. Her\nservile function is equated with certain actions and also certain\nspaces within the house: her tiny bedroom (the chambre de bonne\n\n8 \'the bourgeois family are attacked solely because of their class status - that\'s\n  Marxism\'\n9 Les Bonnes Femmes is set in the workplace but does not really concern social\n  relations.\n\f156     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nor maid\'s room), the back stairs, the kitchen (described to her by\nMadame Lelievre as \'votre domaine\').\'o By fitting into these spaces,\nand entering others only with the authorisation of her employers,\nSophie literally learns to serve. Her friendship with Jeanne entails\na refusal to serve ne vais pas leur obeir\')" and consequently a\nchange of place. It is only when Jeanne visits the house that\nSophie is finally seen using the main staircase rather than the\nback stairs. Her freedom of movement in the house symbolises\nher growing insubordination; it is immediately after a shot of\nSophie openly going up the main stairs on her own that Monsieur\nLelievre fires her. Tellingly, when the murders take place, they are\npresented as a parody of servile duties. Sophie and Jeanne climb\nthe main stairs to the master bedroom as if they were (still) maids:\nJeanne carries a tray of hot chocolate and Sophie is wearing her\napron. They proceed to tear up Madame Lelievre\'s dresses in a\nfrenzied parody of the scenes where they (and other working-class\nvolunteers) sorted the old clothes donated to the \'Secours\ncatholique\'. Monsieur Lelievre is actually shot dead in Sophie\'s\ndomain, the kitchen, before the finale in which the servants finally\nenter the bourgeois inner sanctum - the drawing-room - to kill the\nrest of their masters.\n\n\n\nFemmes jatales\nBut the power struggle in La Ceremonie is not simply a matter of\nthe working classes versus the bourgeoisie. Nor is it really a\nquestion of gender, since Madame Lelievre\'s good looks and\nleisurely lifestyle are just as much the target of Jeanne\'s anger as\nMonsieur Lelievre\'s self-righteousness and autocratic air. As with\nthe Charles-Paul conflicts in Les Cousins and the Helene cycle, or\nthe shifting relations between Why and Frederique in Les Biches\nand between Betty and Laure in Betty, here also there is a personal\nbattle. Sophie and Jeanne are, to a great extent, identified with\neach other, both through the narrative (their secret pasts, their\n[0 \'your domain\'\n[[ \'I\'m not going to obey them\'\n\f                                              MASTER OF CEREMONIE             157\n\n\n common enemy) and the mise en scene (their similar appearance\n and gestures in the later stages of the film). But they are also\n implicitly pitted against each other. At first Sophie is dominated\n by Jeanne (who can read whereas Sophie cannot, who talks while\n Sophie is silent). She even assumes her servile role as the maid in\n Jeanne\'s flat: she is the one who prepares and serves the coffee.\n But ultimately Sophie takes control: she initiates the murders,\n first shooting Monsieur Lelievre and then leading the way into the\n drawing-room to kill the others. The case is much the same as in\n Betty or Les Biches: only the stronger of the two women will\n survive. The reason for this is the dual status of Chabrol\'s female\n protagonists. As he explains with regard to Betty, women in his\n films are at once victims (of a patriarchal society) and also fighters:\n \'Notre univers est masculinise, machiste. Par rapport a cet\n univers, une femme a tous les droits\'" (Berthomieu et al. 1995:\n 13). Ambivalence also characterises Chabrol\'s male characters, for\n example the noble avenger-cowardly liar Charles in Que la bete\n meure or the white knight-greedy manipulator Wolf in Masques\n (their duplicity is suggested by the fact that both act under\n assumed names). But the duality of the women in Chabrol\'s films\n is more generalised, because it is a product of society as he sees it.\n lt is reflected in the heterosexual couple by the Helenes of Le\n Boucher (at once Popaul\'s potential victim and the person indirectly\n responsible for his death) and Juste avant la nuit (the under-\n standing wife who coolly prepares her husband\'s suicide). But it\n also manifests itself within female friendships, including that\nbetween Sophie and Jeanne in La Ceremonie.\n     Duality (or, in a more stigmatised form, duplicity) is also a\ndefining characteristic of the femme fatale archetype from film noir.\nAlthough La Ceremonie cannot be defined as afilm noir, Sophie is\nin certain ways characterised as a dangerous femme fatale (whereas\n Jeanne is not). The first hint comes when she is introduced to her\nduties by Madame Lelievre. The introduction of the femme fatale in\nfilm noir traditionally involves a shot of her descending a staircase,\nwith the focus on her legs - as in Double Indeminity (1944), The\n12   \'Our society is male·dominated and chauvinist. In such a world. a woman has to\n     use whatever she can\'\n\f158    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), or Truffaut\'s La Femme d\'"\n cote (1981). The image ofthefommefatale is also usually dark and\n ominous: \'Film noir lighting suggests duplicity: an unknown threat\nwhich might emerge from the shadows\' (Cook 1980: 78) Both of\n these elements (the composition and the lighting) are echoed in\n Sophie\'s first appearance in her role as the Lelievres\' maid.\n Chabrol shoots her from below, as she descends the dingy back\n stairs into the kitchen. Framing (the focus is on her legs), costume\n (she has put on a dark dress) and lighting (she emerges from\n shadows) all comply with film noir conventions, and encode\n Sop hie as a femme fatale. The effect is also to invert the optimistic\nimplications of the previous scene, in which Sophie watches the\nbeginning of a television drama showing a female lawyer ascend-\ning the white stone steps to a courthouse in daylight. This safe\nimage - of a socially acceptable form of female ambition - is\nreplaced by its opposite: the fomme fatale who will take an anti-\nsocial form of power - the "\'unnatural" phallic power\' of the gun\n (Place 1980: 45) - into her own hands.\n    After the murders, Sophie is again presented as a fomme fatale\n (again, in a way that Jeanne is not). But in this case, the conven-\ntions of the film noir are evoked only to be transcended. Tradition-\nally, the fomme fatale is punished at the end of a film noir. She is\neither literally (via the narrative) or figuratively (via the mise en\nscene) imprisoned, defeated or killed. (Jeanne\'s death in the car\ncrash is not encoded as the punishment of a fomme fatale but as an\nironic coincidence: it is her bete noire the priest who accidentally\nkills her). Whereas Julie\'s fate in us Innocents aux mains sales\nexaggeratedly, almost parodically, adheres to this convention,\nthere is no such punishment for Sophie at the end of La Ceremonie.\nAlthough she is represented as a femme fatale in the final scene (by\nthe expressionist lighting, the shadows, her pale face looming out\nof the night) she escapes closure. Whereas Julie is incarcerated\nalone in her villa and condemned to grieve in a night illuminated\nonly by the hallucinatory image of the mysterious flashing light\n(as if her husband were calling to her from the grave), Sophie\nliterally escapes from the frame, walking away from the house, the\ncrime scene, and the flashing lights of the police. Like Betty, she\n\f                                              MASTER OF CEREMONIE            159\n\n\n survives. But unlike Betty, and unlike the conventional femme\nfatale, Sophie also escapes from the controlling commentary of\n the male voice-over. Like most films noirs, many of Chabrol\' s films\n about women - Betty, Madame Bovary, Une affaire de femmes,\n Violette Noziere and even implicitly Les Innocents aux mains sales (if\n one accepts that the light symbolises Louis calling to Julie) - end\n with a male voice. \'3 It is as if these women are being controlled by\n a male narrator (as indeed, they are - by Simenon, Flaubert and\n Chabrol himself). La Ciremonie however, was largely authored by\nwomen (Ruth Rendell wrote the novel, Caroline Eliacheff co-wrote\nthe screenplay), and, as the police play back the tape-recording of\nthe murder, it ends with the female voices of Sophie and Jeanne.\nAlthough there is a typical Chabrolian ambivalence here - Sophie\nhas been seen to escape, but she has implicated herself, and could\nyet be caught - the fact remains that the murderer, the femme\nfatale, has gone unpunished. Her spectral appearance as she drifts\ninto the night recalls Violette\'s first appearance in Violette Noziere.\n But, as Chabrol\'s own voice tells us, Violette was rehabilitated as a\nsafe woman (the opposite of the femme fatale) through her im-\nprisonment. Sophie has escaped the imprisonment, the rehabili-\ntation and the male voice.\n\n\n\nThe expressionist house\nThe representation of Sophie, Violette and Julie as variations on\nthe femme fatale is partly dependent on Chabrol\'s use of the\nexpressionist mise en scene associated with film noir. Chabrol\'s\nexpressionism also owes a particular debt to Fritz Lang, who used\nit not only in his films noirs but also in westerns and fantasy films.\nIf Hitchcock\'s influence on Chabrol is most evident in terms of\nvoyeurism and point of view (see below, p. 107), Lang\'s legacy is\nclearest in terms of decor. Although the shadowy lighting and\nunsettling camera angles prevalent in expressionism are used\nsparingly in Chabrol\'s films, the symbolic significance of\nexpressionist decor is a constant. Houses and apartments almost\n13 The male voice also controls. even dictates. female actions in L\'Enftr.\n\f160     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nalways express their occupants\' state of mind or destiny. In Les\n Cousins, the weapons on the walls of Paul\'s apartment suggest his\npredatory strength while Charles\'s bedroom isolates him from the\nopen living-space. The glass houses of Leda in A double tour and\nthe Massons in Juste avant la nuit appear to be open and trans-\nparent, but in fact they hide secrets, and the lives lived within will\nprove vulnerable. Helene\'s tower room in Le Boucher symbolises\nher flight from the world, while the blue room HelEme rents in La\n Rupture evokes the threatening presence of Regnier and his plot to\nensnare her. In Violette Noziere, Blood Relatives and Madame Bovary\nthe walls close in like the moral constraints of the bourgeois\nfamily.\n    Much like the Gothic houses in Ten Days\' Wonder and Masques,\nthe house in La Ceremonie is large and isolated. These houses\nfunction as enclosed worlds, ruled by the patriarchal Theo van\nHorn and Legagneur, or the more paternalistic Lelievres. But their\nGothic appearance also creates a sense of foreboding, evoked in\nthe opening shot of each of the houses in question, and heigh-\ntened in the climactic nocturnal sequences from all three films. In\nLa Ceremonie, moreover, great emphasis is placed on the house\'s\nisolation. Madame Lelievre tells Sophie twice in their first inter-\nview that it is \'une maison isolee\',\'4 while the situation of the\nhouse itself is doubled by Sophie\'s room within it (alone. at the\ntop) and the site of the nearest town (Saint Malo. cut off and\nenclosed by its famous walls). The effect is to evoke Sophie\'s own\nisolation. not just as a stranger and a servant in the household. but\nalso as an illiterate. and hence someone who is not fully socialised\nbut remains cut off from the world around her. When confronted\nwith its demands - in the form of the written note from Madame\nLelievre or the telephone call from Monsieur Lelievre - she retreats.\nlike Helene in Le Boucher, and locks herself up in her room.\n    We have already noted the political symbolism of the division\nof space within the Lelievres\' home. The domain of the masters is\nclearly demarcated as the main staircase, the drawing-room, the\ndining-room and (naturally) the master bedroom. Sophie. as the\nservant, is associated with the back stairs and the rooms they link\n14 \'an isolated house\'\n\f                                      MASTER OF CEREMONIE         161\n\n\n- the kitchen and the chambre de bonne. The principal sites of\ncommunication or passage between the two spaces are the main\nstaircase and the oval mirror in the hall. Both belong to the realm\nof the masters, but they allow access to the world \'below stairs\': the\nstaircase because it offers an alternative route to the kitchen and to\nSophie\'s room, the mirror because it reflects the doorway into the\nkitchen, Sophie\'s domain. It is only when she has learned to use\nthe main stairs for her own purposes, and to infiltrate the master\nbedroom, that Sophie masters the house with her gaze. The hall\nmirror, meanwhile, shows Madame Lelievre entering the other\nworld of the kitchen to look for Sophie, but it also shows Sophie\'s\ngradual assumption of power within the house. (The possibility of\na such a metamorphosis is glimpsed when Sophie watches on\ntelevision a programme in which a young woman stares into a\nmirror before accepting a potion from a mysterious magician: it is\nas if she were accepting an invitation to go through the looking-\nglass.) If the first close-up on Sophie\'s face in the hall mirror\nsuggests impotence (she appears to be reading a note, but cannot\nin fact read), the next suggests power (as she listens to Melinda\'s\nphone conversation and learns of her secret pregnancy). As well as\nbeing fundamental in the construction of space as power in La\nCeremonie, the staircase and the mirror are also key motifs from\nexpressionism. In the expressionist mise en scene offilm noir, both\nmotifs are associated with the femme fatale: the staircase to\nsymbolise her dominance over the male characters, the mirror to\nsuggest her narcissism and duality. More generally, in film noir as\nin Chabrol\'s work as a whole, mirrored compositions imply that\n\'nothing and no-one is what it seems\' (Place 1980: 48).\n\n\n\nLooking as power\nThe organisation of space is the key means by which Chabrol\nexpresses power relations in his work. Stairs or split levels allow\none character to dominate another, to look down at their victim.\nThis motif is first seen in Les Cousins, when Paul, on top of a\nladder, looks down at Charles\'s arrival (the telescope he uses even\n\f162    CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n suggests the gun with which he will later kill Charles). It is also\ncrucial to Les Innocents aux mains sales, where Louis\'s power over\nhis wife is equated with his position at the top of the stairs while\nshe is beneath him. And in Dr M, the citizens of Berlin are\ncontrolled by the images on the walls above them. Power is also\nassociated with the outsider looking in. Both L\'(Ei! du malin and Le\n Cri du hibou detail what happens when the voyeur abandons his\ncontrolling position and goes inside. Spatial relations are just as\nexpressive of power in La Ceremonie. In certain key sequences, the\ndominant character organises the space around them and impli-\ncitly controls the others in the frame. This is evident in the very\nfirst scene, where Madame Lelievre meets Sophie in the cafe. The\npoint of view here - and hence the power - is Madame Lelievre\'s.\nShe is the controlling presence, sitting and observing as Sophie\nsearches for the right cafe and then the right table. (In retrospect,\nthis opening scene can also be judged to hint at Sophie\'s\nparticular form of powerlessness, her inability to read: hence her\nconfusion as to which cafe is the right one, her ignorance as to\nwhat day of the week it is, and so on.) But in their next meeting, at\nthe train station, the power relations are subtly reversed. This\ntime, although again the scene is largely experienced from\nMadame Lelievre\'s perspective, she is the one at a disadvantage.\nWhile she waits for Sophie to get off the train, the latter has in fact\nalready arrived. It is the employer and not the maid who is now\nstruggling to find the right place. Eventually Sophie is revealed on\na different platform, silent and ominous, and watching Madame\nLelievre. Even though we are never given Sophie\'s point of view in\nthis sequence, the implication remains that in this instance, she is\nthe one in control. (This is ironic since the explanation for her\nearly arrival on the wrong train and the wrong platform is that she\ncannot read the timetable.)\n    Sophie\'s powerlessness is explained and symbolised not just by\nher servile role, but also by her iIliteracy. She is thus doubly at a\ndisadvantage in relation to her employers. When she desperately\ntries to decode Madame Lelievre\'s note by means of her reading\nmanual, she is equated with a powerless child in an adult world:\nall the photos in the book are of children. The importance of\n\f                                     MASTER OF CEREMONIE        163\n\n\nreading and not being able to read in La Ceremonie is a variation on\nthe theme oflooking as power which informs many of Chabrol\'s\nfilms, and which is derived from Hitchock\'s exploration of voyeur-\nism in Rear Window (1954) and Vertigo (1958). In L\'<Eit du malin,\n Le Cri du hibou and L\'Enfor, the voyeur either deliberately or\nunconsciously destroys the object of his gaze. Masques and Dr M\nfocus on the omnipotent and omnipresent, quasi-divine gaze of\nthe patriarch (Legagneur and Marsfeldt), and contrast it with the\nblindness of their victims (Catherine, the citizens of Berlin). Both\nfilms also express power relations in terms of watching television,\nwhich entails an active, powerful look (the gaze of the screen) and\na passive, impotent look (the gaze at the screen). La Ceremonie\nrevisits the metaphor of television spectatorship as powerlessness.\nSophie\'s passivity and isolation is underlined by her habit of\nwatching TV endlessly in her room. Even when Jeanne accom-\npanies her, the television acts as a neutralising force and positions\nthem as vacant and passive. Whereas the Papin sisters were said to\nhave fused into a third person capable of butchery, Sophie and\nJeanne appear to have fused into a third person capable of little\nmore than staring at the small screen. When they cease watching\nTV, therefore, and actually look down on the Lelievre family sat on\nthe couch watching Mozart\'s Don Giovanni, the change from passive\nspectatorship to active looking is felt as a crucial assumption of\npower.\n   The voyeuristic sequence which precedes the murder is the\nturning-point of the film. It presents Sophie and Jeanne as\npowerful - and the Lelievres as vulnerable - by means of the\nspatial relationship between the two, and specifically though a\ncombination of the Langian metaphor of the staircase and the\nHitchcockian metaphor of the gaze. Stairs, as we have seen, are\nthe site of power for the femme fatale in film noir and for certain\ncharacters in Chabrol\'s work. They are associated in La Ceremonie\nnot just with the master-servant relationship (main staircase and\nback stairs), but also with the power of the priest over his\nparishioners: hence the two scenes in which the priest exercises\nhis authority from the stairs in the church hall, first to reprimand\nthe choirboys for arriving late, and then to dismiss Jeanne and\n\f164   CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\nSophie from the \'Secours catholique\'. The murders in La Ceremonie\ndo not take place on the stairs (as they did in the Papin case and in\nthe British film version, Sister My Sister), but they are precipitated\nand predicted by Sophie and Jeanne\'s dominant position once\nthey have climbed the main staircase to the master bedroom.\nFrom here, they can master the Lelievres with their gaze, looking\ndown on them from the gallery above the drawing-room. As with\nthe disconcerting sequence at the train station, here again the\ncamera shifts from master/s to servant/s, thereby revealing who is\nreally in control. Chabrol pans slowly upwards from the couch\nwhere the family sit watching television to show Sophie and\nJeanne silently observing from the gallery. Twice, we are given the\nservants\' point of view as they look down on their masters.\nPacified and immobilised by their attention to the TV screen, the\nLelievres are excruciatingly vulnerable. (The sound of the opera,\nbesides, will mask the first gunshots and so limit their chances of\nescape.) Within a matter of minutes, the family will be lying dead\non the couch.\n\n\n\nAmbivalence\nLike Chabrol\'s cinema in general, La Ceremonie explores shifting\nrelations between characters, and presents sudden reversals of\npower. Even in the final frame - in this case, Sophie\'s escape from\nthe crime scene - there is rarely a sense of resolution or closure.\nThis adds to the sense that Chabrol\'s work is essentially a cinema\nof ambivalence. His films are funny in both senses: often un-\nexpectedly comic, they are also strange, unsettling and disturbing.\nTheir ambivalence is most evident in the fluctuating tone, the\nopen endings, and the lack of moral judgement that these endings\nimply. Very few of Chabrol\'s films are totally consistent in tone.\nWhere farce dominates, there are also moments of poignancy, as\nin the endings of Les Noces rouges and Folies bourgeoises. Even the\ndarkest and most serious of his films is punctuated by black\nhumour: the Fascist newsreels of L\'am de Vichy are edited\ntogether with a sly and devastating irony, so that the propagandist\n\f                                     MASTER Of CEREMONIE        165\n\n\nintentions of the original soundtrack are undermined by the\nresonance of the images (shots of charcoal burners and holiday\ntrains evoking the Holocaust, for example). The most frequent\ndisruptions of tone in Chabrol\'s work are not however in the\nediting, but in the acting.\n    Sudden eruptions of comic clowning or of theatrical overacting\noften break through the classic realism of the mise en scene and at\ntimes even question the realist illusion (that we are watching\nactual rather than staged events). The neorealist bleakness of Les\nBonnes Femmes is qualified by the exaggerated hamming of Pierre\nBertin as the store-owner, in a grotesque parody of the romantic\nhero that Jacqueline dreams of. Slightly less out of place in La\nRupture - because it is a melodrama - but equally comic are the\ngestures and delivery ofMario David as the unemployed thespian\nwho enlivens the Pinellis\' guest-house. In Que la hete meure, the\nrealism of the narrative is suddenly and self-consciously disturbed\nby the appearance ofJean-Louis Maury as a peasant, appearing out\nof nowhere to give Charles the clues he needs to track down Paul\nDecourt. Rather than disguise the plotting here, Chabrol simply\nexaggerates it, with the huge \'detour\' signs and the mysterious\npeasant foregrounding the role of coincidence. Such is the peasant\'s\nself-referential status (and such is his physical appearance) that\nsome commentators have erroneously suggested that he is played\nby Chabrol himself. Chabrol does pull off a comic turn as the\nphilandering bourgeois father in La Muette, but usually he relies\non the comic duo of Henri Attal and Dominique Zardi to provide\nthe light relief in numerous films, including Les Biches (the\npretentious and irritating intellectuals Robegue and Riais) , La\nFemme infidele (a client in a cafe and the motorist who crashes into\nCharles\'s car), Juste avant la nuit (the investigating detective and\nCharles\'s foppish advertising partner) and even Madame Bovary\n(the bailiff and the blind man, the latter another personification of\nfate in Chabrol\'s work and a reprise ofZardi\'s role as the balloon-\nseller in La Rupture). Similarly, Fran~ois Maistre appears in\nseveral comic roles - as one of the detectives in Ies Innocents aux\nmains sales, the euphemistic judge in Une affaire de femmes, and\nthe speech-giver in the \'Cornices\' scene from Madame Bovary. (Ies\n\f166     CLAUDE CHABROL\n\n\n Innocents aux mains sales is one of the most sustained examples of\nambivalent tone in Chabrol\'s cinema, presenting as it does the\nstruggle of a femme fatale to maintain her dignity while being\ntormented by two detectives and a fast-talking lawyer; one could\nsay that the film thereby enacts a struggle between genres - the\nfilm noir versus the comedy thriller.) It is to this strand of clowns\nand buffoons - often blissfully unaware of the gravity of the narra-\ntive in which they find themselves - that the unctuous priest in La\n Ceremonie belongs. Here, the effect is simply comic rather than\nself-referential: Jean-Fran~ois Perrier is always rolling his eyes\nand wringing his hands, whether he is scolding Jeanne and\nSophie at the church hall, or explaining to the police how he\nmanaged to kill the former in a car crash.\n    The ending of La Ceremonie is ambivalent in that it asks\nquestions which can be answered one of two ways. Firstly, and\nmost obviously, will Sophie be caught by the police? Secondly,\nthere is the moral question of how the spectator interprets the\nkilling of the Lelievres. Chabrol carefully times the playback of the\nincriminating tape so that the final credits finish with Jeanne\'s\nremark to Sophie: \'On a bien fait?\'.\'5 Moreover, on the playback\nthe question is addressed directly to the audience rather than to\nSophie. Thus La Ceremonie ends with a question mark, as do so\nmany of Chabrol\'s films, including Le Beau Serge (has Fran~ois\nsacrificed himself?) , Les Biches (is Paul next?), La Femme infidele (is\nthis ending happy or sad?), Que la bete meure (will Charles survive?)\nand L\'Enftr (is Nelly alive or dead?). But here the question is voiced\nrather than just implied. As a result, the difficulty of making a\nmoral judgement is rendered explicit here, while it is implicit\nelsewhere (at the end of L\'(Ei! du malin, Que la bite meure, Le\nBoucher and others). La Ceremonie dramatises the choice that the\nindividual spectator is faced with at the end of most of Chabrol\'s\nfilms. The depiction of the victims and the perpetrators has been\ndeliberately even-handed even if, as in Nada, one senses the\ndirector\'s political preference. Whatever one\'s final judgement,\nthe posing of the moral dilemma illustrates Chabrol\'s belief that\n15 \'Did we do right?\'. Although one could interpret this as a statement of fact (\'We\n   did right\'), Huppert\'s intonation suggests that it is more of a question.\n\f                                              MASTER OF cEREMONIE               167\n\n\n\'11 n\'est pas d\'ames toutes noires, ni toutes blanches\'I6 (Chabrol\n1976: 53). It also demonstrates a lack of closure - the key deviation\nin his work from the conventions of genre cinema, and the major\nlink with art cinema.\n\n\n\nIs Chabrol an auteur?\nAlthough ambivalence and lack of closure are characteristic of art\ncinema (see Bordwell 1979), they do not in themselves identify\nChabrol as an auteur. Nor is the fact that we have been able to\nisolate recurrent motifs in numerous films - of different genres\nand over a period of forty years - totally conclusive. There is how-\never a certain consistency of theme, style and form throughout\nmuch of his career. Most convincingly, Chabrol\'s statements in\nhis autobiography and in numerous interviews (again over many\nyears) confirm the impression of a personal vision running\nthrough his work: \'Ce que je cherche c\'est que l\'ensemble de mes\nrealisations donne une idee tres precise d\'une vision des choses\'I7\n(Chabrol 1976: 347). Chabrol, at least, seems persuaded that he is\nan auteur. And in La Ceremonie, as well as reprising several\nfavourite concerns, he even indulges in a classic auteurist gesture,\nwhen the Lelievres watch Les Noces rouges on television. Whatever\nthe practical explanation - Chabrol claims that he wanted a\nsuggestive scene, and that it was simply cheaper to show one from\nhis own film than from someone else\'s (Berthomieu et al. 1995:\n11) - this functions as a self-referential aside. Like Truffaut - who\nincludes clips from his earlier films in L\'Amour en foite (1979) -\nChabrol refers not just to idols like Hitchcock, but increasingly to\nhis own filmography. This is evident not just in La Ceremonie, but\nalso in Poulet au vinaigre, which takes its ending directly from\nFolies bourgeoises.\n    The status of auteur was in a sense officially conferred on\nChabrol by Cahiers du cinema in October 1997, when they devoted\n\n16 \'No soul is completely evil. nor completely good\'\n17 \'What I\'m after is that my films as a whole give a very precise idea of a personal\n   vision\'\n\f168     ClAUDE CHABROl\n\n\na special issue to his career. But this came rather late in the day,\nafter notable resistance to the idea in the 1960s and 1970s. The\nstumbling-block seems to have been his reliance on popular\ngenres, and this - along with his emphasis on the collective nature\nof film-making - remains an important qualification of the\ncategorisation of Chabrol as an auteur. None the less, as the critics\non Cahiers du cinema argued in the 1950S (Chabrol among them),\na director working within the constraints of genre cinema can still\nbe an auteur. witness Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang, Howard\nHawks or Nicholas Ray. It has simply taken the French film press\na very long time to realise that this argument applies to Chabrol\ntoo. Finally, it should be stressed that a Chabrol film from the late\n1950S is not the same as one from the early 1990s. In particular,\nChabrol\'s balancing of commercial constraints with formal\nexperimentation underwent a major shift during the 1960s. It is\nnot unreasonable to see at least three distinct periods in his career:\nthe experimentation of the new wave, the purely commercial years\nthat followed, and the relative freedom of the three decades since\nLes Biches in 1967. (One might also choose to distinguish between\nthe periods before and after Marin Karmitz became Chabrol\'s\nregular producer in 1985.) Only after Les Biches has Chabrol been\nable to make the films he wants to in more or less the way that he\nwants to. This has entailed (as a deliberate choice rather than an\nenforced necessity) the exploration of auteurist concerns within\npopular genres. After swinging in the 1960s from one extreme to\nthe other, over the last thirty years Chabrol has managed to unite\nauteurism and genre cinema in a successful hybrid which stands\nas a landmark in French film.\n\n\n\nReferences\nBerthomieu, P., leancolas, I.·P., and Vasse, c., (1995) Entretien avec Claude\n   Chabrol, Positif. 416 (September), 8-14.\nBordwell, D.

(Very few directors, at least in the\nmodem era, have made fifty films.) The rapturous critical recep-\ntion for La Ceremonie in 1995 was followed by a series of events\ncentred around the release of Rien ne va plus in autumn 1997,\nincluding the publication of a special issue of Cahiers du cinema\nand retrospectives of Chabrol\'s films at the Institut Lumiere in\nLyons, the Champo cinema in Paris, the French film festival in\nFlorence and the international film festival in Thessalonika. But\nin the midst of these homages to Chabrol as an auteur the fact\nremains that, in a typically contrary and humorous gesture, his\nfiftieth film is - at least ostensibly - one of the least serious and\nmost enjoyably generic movies of his career.\n    Rien ne va plus does include self-conscious, auteurist references\nto Chabrol\'s earlier films, such as Juste avant la nuit (the wintry\nsetting, the shot of the oval mirror, the stained handkerchief), Les\nNoces rouges (the handcuffing together of the two protagonists)\nand Betty (the reconciliation at the end to the strains of Michel\nJonasz). But it places itself above all in the genre of the comic spy/\ncaper movie, exemplified by the James Bond series (begun in\n1962) and by Chabrol\'s own work between 1964 and 1967 (in part\na French response to Bond). The film concerns the relationship\nbetween two crooks, Betty (Isabelle Huppert) and Victor (Michel\nSerrault), as they engage in a number of confidence tricks.\nTempted to step out of their league in order to steal five million\n\f                                                  AFTERWORD      171\n\n\nSwiss francs, they end up facing the larger-than-life Monsieur K\n (Jean-Fran~ois Balmer). In common with the Bond series and\nChabrol\'s mid-196os work such as the two Tigres and La Route de\n Corinthe, Rim ne va plus features exotic locations (St Moritz and\nGuadeloupe), elaborate scenes of pursuit and interrogation, out-\nlandish thugs and an eccentric crime lord. like the archetypal\nBond fIlm, it begins in a casino and ends in a remote, romantic\nhide-away. Above all, the film refers back to Chabrol\'s 1965 spy\nspoof, Marie-Chantal contre Docteur Kha. Hence the sequences in\nthe Swiss hotel and on the Alpine ski-lifts, the use of trains and\nplanes, the cosmopolitan cast of minor characters (spies in Marie-\nChantal, hotel guests in Rim ne va plus), the comedy cameos\n(Chabrol as a barman in the former, his son Thomas as a bell-boy\nin the latter) and the sinister villains (Docteur Kha and his\nnamesake Monsieur K).\'\n    The playful balance between obvious generic stereotypes and\nless obvious auteurist references is paralleled by the role oflies and\ntruth in the fIlm. Various interviews and reviews have quoted\nChabrol\'s assertion that Rien ne va plus is his first autobiographical\nfIlm. This view would appear to neglect Le Beau Serge and Les\nCousins, as well as the roles played by Michel Bouquet in La Femme\ninfidele and Juste avant la nuit. But it is given some credence by the\nfact that Rien ne va plus is Chabrol\'s first original screenplay since\nMasques (co-written with Odile Barski in 1986), and his first solo\noriginal screenplay since Alice ou la derniere fUgue in 1977. The\nfilm may be peopled by generic stereotypes and affectionate\nparodies, but somewhere among the games, the deceptions, the\nsimulations and reflections which recur throughout (Betty and\nVictor\'s multiple identities, the two attache cases, the false ending\nand the real one, even the Alpine landscapes perfectly reflected in\nmountain lakes), there is perhaps an autobiographical truth. If\nthis truth is to be found anywhere, it is in the mysterious\nrelationship between Victor and Betty. Are they lovers? Father and\ndaughter (she sometimes calls him \'Papa\')? Or are they director\nand star, the former a representation of Chabrol and the latter a\n\n I   The two names sound the same in French.\n\f172      ClAUOE CHABROl\n\n\ntribute to IsabeUe Huppert (and, more generally, to the impor-\ntance of actresses in his recent work)?\n    Betty is crucial to the mise en scene of Victor\'s projects: she is his\nleading actress. Moreover, she indulges in a Chabrolian love of\nmasks and mysteries. like Chabrol, Victor is a professional, a cratfs-\nman, who steers away from grandiose projects and prides himself\non his pragmatism. He enjoys the good life and believes not so\nmuch that intelligence brings happiness, but that happiness\nbrings intelligence - as he tells Betty. Working together, the two\ntarget middle-class victims (conferences of salesman or dentists),\ninitially entertaining them so that they don\'t realise they\'ve been\nconned until later (a possible metaphor for the subersive after-\neffects of Chabrol\'s cinema). But it is not just Victor and Betty who\ncan be seen as alter egos for the director. Monsieur K also fulfils\nthat function, elaborately staging the interrogation and putting it\nto music. Where Chabrol timed the murders in La Ceremonie to fit\nthe cadences of Mozart\'s Don Giovanni, so Monsieur K matches\nhis questioning ofBetty and Victor to the finale ofPuccini\'s Tosca.\nTwice he asks for the last scenes of the opera to be played, and\ntwice the music rises to a crescendo just as the action reaches a\nclimax (first when Betty discovers Maurice dead in the bath, and\nagain when she guesses the combination for the attache case).\nEven the anti-imperialist commentary heard on the plane and the\ndeclaration on a TV show watched by Victor that truth is stranger\nthan fiction seem to voice Chabrol\'s own preoccupations.\n    If Rien ne va plus is a personal manifesto, however, it is so not\njust in its evident affection for genre cinema and its hints at auto-\nbiographical revelations. It is most memorable and most defiant\n(given the rather worthy circumstances of the film\'s release) in its\nsudden changes of tone and its celebration of bad taste. Hence the\ncharacterisation of Monsieur K as a hybrid figure of parody,\nmenace and black humour. His account of the gruesome torture\nand murder of Maurice is punctuated with macabre jokes:\nMaurice was apparently \'intarissable\',\' and told K everything he\nknew, not only about himself, but also about the lives of his\n\n 2   \'he wouldn\'t shut up\'\n\f                                                        AFTERWORD   173\n\n\nparents, his sisters, his nephews. The villa sequence involving\nMonsieur K also features kitsch decor (black-and-white animal-\nskin chairs) and elements offarce. When K breaks Victor\'s finger,\nthe former\'s mistress tries to ease the pain by sucking on it with\nevident sexual relish. For the next few scenes, the broken middle\nfinger sticks up at a provocative angle, as if symbolising Victor\'s\nchallenge to the gangsters. The mystery surrounding Victor and\nBetty is frequently undercut by their surroundings, which tend to\nbe banal (the dormobile they travel around in, where there is\nbarely room to wash up) or kitsch (the Alpine landscapes, the\nSwiss hotel, the beach in Guadeloupe). A final shift in tone and a\nfinal celebration of kitsch is provided by the fairytale ending which\ntakes place, the caption assures us, \'Un siecle plus tard\') Pre-\ntending to have been crippled by the gangsters, Victor waits in an\nisolated Swiss chalet for the arrival of Betty (who is still driving the\ntrusty dormobile). In a false ending, they exchange a few home\ntruths before she takes off again. But a moment later, as Betty\nlistens to a sentimental Michel Jonasz song, she turns round and\nreturns. The couple are reunited in a romantic embrace and the\ncredits roll as the song declares \'Changez tout. Qu\' est-ce que vous\nferiez sans nous?\'.4 Like a fairytale of cinema, Chabrol ends his\nfiftieth film with a rare happy ending, and a suggestion that he\n(and Huppert?) may even be dreaming of a century of film-\nmaking.\n\n\n\n\n 3 \'A century later\'\n 4 \'Change everything. What would you do without us?\'\n\fFilmography\n\n\n\nLe Beau Serge (1958)\n93 mins, b/w\nProduction Company: AJYM-Films\nScreenplay: Claude Chabrol\nPhotography: Henri Decae\nSound: Jean-Claude Marchetti\nMusic: Emile Delpierre\nEditing: Jacques Gaillard\nPrincipal actors: Gerard Blain (Serge), Jean-Claude Brialy (Franc;:ois),\n   Bernadette Laffont (Marie), MicheIe Meritz (Yvonne).\n\nLes Cousins (1958) (U K/U SA: The Cousins)\n110 mins, b/w\nProduction company: AJYM-Films, Societe franc;:aise du cinema\n   pour la jeunesse\nScreenplay: Claude Chabrol and Paul Gegauff\nPhotography: Henri Decae\nSound: Jean-Claude Marchetti\nMusic: Paul Misraki, Mozart, Wagner\nEditing: Jacques Gaillard\nPrincipal actors: Gerard Blain (Charles), Jean-Claude Brialy (Paul),\n   Juliette Mayniel (Florence), Claude Cerval (Clovis).\n\f                                             FILMOGRAPHY      175\n\nAdouble tour   (1959) (UKjUSA: Leda/Web of Passion)\n100  mins, col.\nProduction company: Paris-Films, Titanus Films\nScreenplay: Paul Gegauff, based on the novel The Key to Nicholas\n   Street by Stanley Ellin\nPhotography: Henri Decae\nSound: Jean-Claude Marchetti\nMusic: Paul Misraki, Mozart, Berlioz\nEditing: Jacques Gaillard\nPrincipal actors: Madeleine Robinson (Therese Marcoux), Jacques\n   Dacquemine (Henri Marcoux), Antonella Lualdi (Leda), Jean-\n   Paul Belmondo (Lazlo Kovacs).\n\nLes Bonnes Femmes (1960) (UKjUSA: The Girls)\n95 mins, bjw\nProduction company: Paris-Films, Panitalia\nScreenplay: Paul Gegauff and Claude Chabrol\nPhotography: Henri Decae\nSound: Jean-Claude Marchetti\nMusic: Paul Misraki, Pierre Jansen\nEditing: Jacques Gaillard\nPrincipal actors: Stephane Audran (Ginette), Bernadette Laffont\n   (Jane), Clotilde Joano (Jacqueline), Lucile Saint-Simon (Rita).\n\nLes Godelureaux (1960)\n99 mins, bjw\nScreenplay: Eric Ollivier and Paul Gegauff, based on the novel by\n   Ollivier\nPhotography: Henri Decae\nSound: Jean-Claude Marchetti\nMusic: Maurice Leroux, Pierre Jansen\nEditing: James Cuenet\nPrincipal actors: Jean-Claude Brialy (Ronald), Charles Belmont\n   (Arthur), Bernadette Laffont (Ambroisine).\n\f176   FILMOGRAPHY\n\n\nL\'Avarice (1961)\n18 mins. b/w\nProduction company: Gibe-Franco-London-Titanus\nScreenplay: Felicien Marceau\nPhotography: Jean Rabier\nSound: Jean Labussiere\nMusic: Pierre Jansen\nEditing: Jacques Gaillard\nPrincipal actors: Jacques Charrier.

The first book-length study of\nHitchcock, and thus a landmark in auteurist film criticism.\nAlthough Chabrol only wrote the sections on the English films\nand on Rebecca, Stage Fright and Notorious, the book reveals his\nattitudes to subjects such as film form, subjective narration and\nthe theme of redemption through love. (Trans. S. Hochman,\nHitchcock: The First Forty-Four Films, New York, Continuum, 1988.)\n\nEt pourtant je toume ... , Paris, Robert Laffont, 1976. An essential\nbook not just about Chabrol, but about the making of films in\ngeneral. Includes autobiography, appreciations of Hitchcock, Lang\nand others, a diary of the making of Les Magiciens, anecdotes about\nthe film business, attacks on censorship and film critics, definitions\nof the roles within a film crew, and answers to a questionnaire\nabout personal likes and dislikes. Recently published by Ramsay\n(Poche-Cinema) .\n\nBooks on Chabrol\nBlanchet, c., Claude Chabrol, Paris, Rivages, 1989. Probably the best\nbook on Chabrol to date. The first half gives excellent close read-\n\f192   SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n\nings of the films in chronological order. The second half is less\nclearly structured, but includes a useful analysis of Chabrol\'s\ninfluences and his privileging of mise en scene over subject matter.\n\nBraucourt, G., Claude Chabrol, Paris, ~ditions Seghers, Collection\n\'Cinema d\'aujourd\'hui, 1971. The excellent closing section pro-\nvides an anthology of Chabrol\'s comments on all aspects of his\nwork, culled from various interviews. For this reason alone, a very\nuseful introduction to Chabrol\'s early and middle periods. But,\nlike many books on Chabrol, tends to privilege discussions of\npsychology over the analysis of mise en scene.\n\nMagny, J., Claude Chabrol, Paris, Cahiers du cinema, Collection\n\'Auteurs\', 1987. Well-informed but surprisingly monotonous work.\nCovers many of Chabrol\'s films up until the mid-eighties, but\nreiterates the same (rather obvious) conclusions about Chabrol\'s\nattitudes to power, money, God, the bourgeoisie, etc. A frustrating\ntendency to bracket together films from different periods under\nobscure title headings, e.g. \'Dieu est mort\'. Does at least feature a\nlong interview with Chabrol and a couple of his early essays as\nappendices.\n\nMonaco, J., The New Wave, New York and Oxford, Oxford\nUniversity Press, 1976. A review of the new wave which features\none chapter on Chabrol. There is an excellent introduction to his\ncareer and his new wave work. The pace quickens for the seventies\nfilms, each of which is only given a couple of pages or so. The\naccounts of the later films remain illuminating but there is less\nroom for sustained analysis.\n\nWood, R., and Walker, M., Claude Chabrol, London, Studio Vista,\nMovie Paperbacks, 1970. As Walker was to admit in a 1975 article\nfor Movie magazine, this book is mainly a character-based analysis\nofChabrol\'s first decade in cinema.
