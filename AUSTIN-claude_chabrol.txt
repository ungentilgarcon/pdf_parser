Series editors' foreword



To an anglophone audience, the combination of the words 'French'
and 'cinema' evokes a particular kind of film: elegant and wordy,
sexy but serious - an image as dependent on national stereotypes
as is that of the crudely commercial Hollywood blockbuster, which
is not to say that either image is without foundation. Over the past
two decades, this generalised sense of a significant relationship
between French identity and film has been explored in scholarly
books and articles, and has entered the curriculum at university
level and, in Britain, at A-level. The study of film as an art-form
and (to a lesser extent) as industry, has become a popular and
widespread element of French Studies, and French cinema has
acquired an important place within Film Studies. Meanwhile, the
growth in multi-screen and 'art-house' cinemas, together with the
development of the video industry, has led to the greater avail-
ability of foreign-language films to an English-speaking audience.
Responding to these developments, this series is designed for
students and teachers seeking information and accessible but
rigorous critical study of French cinema, and for the enthusiastic
filmgoer who wants to know more.
   The adoption of a director-based approach raises questions
about auteunsm. A series that categorises films not according to
period or to genre (for example), but to the person who directed
them, runs the risk of espousing a romantic view of film as the
product of solitary inspiration. On this model, the critic's role might
seem to be that of discovering continuities, revealing a necessary
viii   SERIES EDITORS' FOREWORD


coherent set of themes and motifs which correspond to the parti-
cular genius of the individual. This is not our aim: the auteur
perspective on film, itself most clearly articulated in France in the
early 195os, will be interrogated in certain volumes of the series,
and, throughout, the director will be treated as one highly
significant element in a complex process of film production and
reception which includes socio-economic and political determin-
ants, the work of a large and highly skilled team of artists and
technicians, the mechanisms of production and distribution, and
the complex and multiply determined responses of spectators.
   The work of some of the directors in the series is already
known outside France, that of others is less so - the aim is both to
provide informative and original English-language studies of
established figures, and to extend the range of French directors
known to anglophone students of cinema. We intend the series to
contribute to the promotion of the informal and formal study of
French films, and to the pleasure of those who watch them.

Chabrol and friends



In the autumn of 1997, at the age of 67, Claude Chabrol released
Rien ne va plus, his fiftieth HIm. The leading French film magazine,
Cahiers du cinema, marked the occasion with a special issue
devoted entirely to his work. The editorial described him as 'le
cineaste fran~ais le plus productif, et peut-etre le plus "rentable",
des quatre demieres decennies" (Toubiana 1997: 4). (His achieve-
ment is all the more remarkable when one notes that in recent
years several previously successful French film directors have
been more or less obliged to abandon the cinema, including Leos
Carax, Jean-Jacques Beineix and Bertrand Blier.) Chabrol's forty-
year career is in some ways a history of recent French cinema and
society: neorealism, the new wave, the trauma of the Algerian
War, the political legacy of 1968, the rise of the consumer society
and the 'pompidolien' bourgeoisie; the perennial popularity of
the thriller, the tension between television and cinema, the
decline of Marxism. Chabrol has known periods of great success
(the launching of the new wave in 1958, the superb Helene cycle
of the late 1960s - including his most famous film Le Boucher-
his return to form in the 1990s), and also periods of inactivity and
failure (a year in the early 1960s without shooting a single scene, a
general loss of direction in the late 1970s). Twice he has relaunched

I   'the most prolific and perhaps the most ·profitable" French film-maker of the
    last four decades'
2   That is to say, the bourgeoisie of 1969-74, the period of Georges Pompidou's
    presidency.
4    CLAUDE CHABROL


The result is a filmography which contains turkeys (Folies bour-
geoises, Quiet Days in Clichy) as well as masterpieces (the Helene
cycle, Betty, La Cirimonie) , but which is finally being recognised as
 a landmark in French cinema.
     Typically, Chabrol's autobiography is published not in an auteurist
 cinema collection but in the series 'Un homme et son metier'.9
 For him, directing is a job which can be demystified from the
 auteurist/Romantic idea of it. His concept of cinema privileges the
 spectator as well as the creator - hence the importance of genre in
 his work, since it is often via the expectations aroused by popular
 genres that a spectator approaches a given film. Rejecting the
 avant-garde and the experimental, Chabrol chooses (even when he
 doesn't have to, financially speaking) to work within the confines
 of established genres. In 1979 he declared that 'I've always tried to
hold on to the cinema of genre because I think it's the only way to
 make films. These days in France, but not only there, one veers
mostly towards an overly intellectual vision of things, and I think
the only solution is to make some good policiers, some good soap-
operas and comedies' (Yakir 1979: 2). Chabrol has in fact filmed
farce (Folies bourgeoises), melodrama (La Rupture), fantasy (Alice ou
 la dernierefugue) , war films (La Ligne de dimarcation, Une affaire de
femmes), spy films (the Tigre series and La Route de Corinthe) and
glossy literary adaptations (Quiet Days in Clichy, Madame Bovary).
 But the crime thriller is his usual choice of genre, because it
allows him to engage the spectator via the plot, and then explore
the complexities of character, morality, society and politics within
an accessible and satisfying framework. Or as he puts it, 'c'est le
genre qui emmerde le moins le public'lo (Sorg 1998: 35). He has
often been described as specialising in the psychological thriller,
but this is slightly misleading. Although he is greatly interested in
character and situation, Chabrol does not concern himself with
psychology as an area of knowledge. Human motivations remain
obscure rather than transparent. Actions (particularly crimes) and

   private detective, an agronomist, a king, and, despite the series title, by a
   businesswoman and a (female) singer.

                                                CHABROl AND FRIENDS            5

their consequences are shown in uncompromising - and often
blackly comic - detail, but no comforting explanations are given.
As Chabrol says, 'mon grand plaisir, c'est de reveler l'opacite'"
(Guerin and Jousse 1995: 30). This is particularly true of his
female characters. How much do we learn about the enigmatic
and ultimately disembodiedl2 female protagonists of films such as
Le Boucher, Les Innocents aux mains sales, Violette Noziere, Betty and
La Ceremonie? Even the male characters - whose psychology is
often less obscure - tend to maintain an ambivalence which thwarts
simple definitions of good and evil. From Le Beau Serge and Les
Cousins, via Que la bite meure and Le Boucher, to Masques and Le
Cri du hibou, they are simultaneously victims and perpetrators.
Moral relativism is the recurrent theme of Chabrol's work: 'my
"great testament," my "definitive message" is ... Don't judge!'
(Yakir 1979: 5)·
    Although there is a personal (moral) imperative underlying
Chabrol's films, their means of production is collective. This is of
course true of almost all films, but with Chabrol there is great
emphasis on the contribution of the film crew. From his very first
films, Chabrol built up a trusted team which has continued to work
with him more or less throughout his career. The heart of the crew
has been as follows: Jean Rabier (cinematography), Guy Chichignoud
(sound), Pierre Jansen (music), Jacques Gaillard/Monique Fardoulis
(editing). There have also been favourite actors at various periods
ofChabrol's career, including Jean-Claude Brialy, Michel Bouquet,
Jean Yanne, Stephane Audran and Isabelle Huppert. Audran and
Huppert have been especially important, incarnating the enig-
matic and ultimately unknowable heroines of some of Chabrol's
most famous work. Audran was Chabrol's second wife, and has
appeared in over twenty of his films, from Les Cousins in 1958 to
Betty in 1992. Above all, she starred in the Helene cycle of 1968-
71, in which she embodied the bourgeoisie of the period and
facilitated Chabrol's ambivalent attitude towards it: 'Elle en repre-
sente une idealisation ... L'idee etait que les films devenaient

Il   'my great pleasure is to reveal opacity'

6    CLAUDE CHABROL


 doubles: it la fois une satire de la bourgeoisie et un aboutissement,
 une sorte de modele"J (Jousse and Toubiana 1997: 8). In 1978,
 Isabelle Huppert took the lead in Violette Noziere while Audran
 played her mother. The torch was in a sense being passed from
one to the other, with Huppert going on to work regularly with
 Chabrol over the next two decades.
    Always a metaphorical family, Chabrol's film crew has recently
become something of a literal family too. His third wife Aurore is
still the 'script-girl' (as she has been since the 1970s) and his step-
daughter Ct~cile Maistre is now the first assistant. One of his sons,
 Matthieu, composes the score (replacing Pierre Jansen in 1982),
while another, Thomas, has appeared in Une affaire de femmes,
 Madame Bovary, Betty and L'Enfer. Chabrol has always been
renowned for his good humour on the set, and for the affection
generated within his film crews, actors included: 'La creation se
fait rnieux dans la joie. Pourquoi ne pas vivre en bons compagnons,
etre doux les uns avec les autres, de temps en temps faire la fete,
en tout cas se marrer le plus souvent possible, bien bouffer?"4
(Chabrol 1976: 186). It may well be that the relaxed atmosphere of
his shoots and his well-known love of good food and drink added
to his long-standing reputation as a casual film-maker. It is
certainly true that he filmed Ten Days' Wonder in Alsace solely in
order to enjoy the local cuisine, and that he was drunk for most of
the shoot on La Ligne de demarcation. But his attitude remains
unchanged. As he recently told Te1erama on the set of his fifty-first
film, Au creur du mensonge, 'On ne sait jamais si un film sera
reussi ni s'il aura du succes .... Par contre, on peut toujours reussir
le tournage, et en faire un succes'l, (Sorg 1998: 35).
    Although Chabrol wrote some of his most famous films alone
(including La Femme infidele and Le Boucher), he collaborated with

13 'She represents an idealisation of it ... The idea was that the films became
   double·edged: at the same time a satire on the bourgeoisie and its culmination,
   a kind of model'
14 'Creativity is aided by happiness. Why not be good friends, why not be nice to
   each other, live it up now and then, in any case have a laugh as often as possible
   and eat well?'
15 'You never know if a film will work, nor ifitwill bea success. On the other hand,
   you can always make the filming work. and make it a success'

his friend Paul Gegauff on many screenplays over the first twenty
years of his career. Perhaps the most productive influence within
Chabrol's crew, Gegauff was also the most destructive personality.
Chabrol first met him in 1950 at Le Celtic film club in the Latin
Quarter of Paris. Chabrol was in the audience as Gegauff, dressed
as a Nazi officer, interrupted the screening of a British war film to
complain that it was in bad taste. This anecdote encapsulates
Gegauffs dangerous appeal: a dandy and a joker, a Germano-
phile, a scourge of good taste, of bourgeois manners and morals.
He was also, in the early 1950s, a successful novelist and some-
thing of a playboy. He became an influence on several of the
young new wave directors, including Eric Rohmer and Jean-Luc
Godard. To Chabrol, he became a close friend and a fascinating
model of cynicism and amorality. GegaufPs apparent racism and
right-wing views, like his drinking and womanising, made a
tantalising contrast with Chabrol's own left-wing humanism, and
his status as a Catholic family man. 16 The attraction and contrast
between Chabrol and Gegauff was to be represented time and
again in two character types, Charles and Paul. (Usually they are
male rivals for Helene, a female character based to a degree on
Stephane Audran.) Charles is an ironic version of the young Chabrol:
innocent, reserved, repressed. Paul is Gegauff: cynical, charis-
matic, provocative. Established in 1958 with Les Cousins, Chabrol's
second film and the first on which Gegauff collaborated, the
pairing was to reappear, with slight variations (and changes of
name) in Les Godelureaux (Arthur and Ronald), Les Biches (Paul),
La Femme infidele (Charles and Victor), Que la bete meure (Charles
and Paul), Le Boucher (Charles and Popaul), La Rupture (Charles
and Paul),Juste avant la nuit (Charles), and Docteur Popaul (Popaul).
The series culminated in 1974 with Une partie de plaisir, after which
Gegauffs dandies tend to disappear from Chabrol's work. (The
final film collaboration between the two was Les Magiciens a year
later, featuring a dandy called Edouard. It was a commercial

16 Although Chabrol has always maintained that Gegauffs racism was simply a
   ploy to wind up left-wingers like himself. Antoine de Baecque. in an excellent
   essay. has accused Gegauff of genuine anti-Semitism. I have made use of this
   essay (de Baecque 1997) for my account of Gegauffs life and death.
8    CLAUDE CHABROL


disaster, and Chabrol reckons it is one of his very worst films.)
    Une partie de plaisir dramatises - and hence exorcises - the
power of GegaufPs personality. That power is described by Chabrol
as follows: '11 fascinait par son cote jusqu'auboutiste dans l'auto-
destruction, un gout du paradoxe extraordinaire et une elegance
vraie. Mais il m'a montre egalement jusqu'ou cette direction
pouvait aller dans l'autodestruction'I7 (de Baecque 199T 90).
 Based on an autobiographical screenplay by Gegauff, Une partie de
plaisir details the break-up of an apparently happy family. Raw and
traumatic in its realism (brought home by Chabrol's decision to
have Gegauff, his ex-wife, and their little daughter all play their
fictional selves - in their own house!), the film is also telling in its
symbolism: a working-through ofChabrol's fears about Gegauffs
destructive potential. Although at times fascinating and impress-
ive - entertaining his guests, discoursing on art and philosophy,
arguing brilliantly with hippies lB - the fictional Gegauff is also
repulsive (he is equated at one point with a spider attacking its
prey). Like an intimate version of the right-wing patriarchs from
certain Chabrol films, Gegauffs character is autocratic and mani-
pulative: he uses his daughter and patronises, humiliates and
assaults his wife, finally appearing to kill her. It is in fact Chabrol's
own ideal - the family - that is threatened by Gegauff (fictional
and real). (Chabrol tends to make a distinction between the bour-
geois family - which he considers a valid target for Gegauff and
his alter egos - and the 'real' non-bourgeois, family - which he
idealises.) On screen, Gegauff ends up in prison. Off screen, he
began to drink more and more heavily, and gradually ceased to
work with Chabrol. His last scenario for the latter was a television
adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe in 1981. In late 1983, Gegauff rang
Chabrol to say that after spending Christmas in Norway, he hoped
to collaborate on a film project once more. On Christmas Eve, his
young Norwegian wife stabbed him to death.

17 'He fascinated me by pushing at the limits of self·destruction, by his taste for
   extraordinary paradoxes and his real elegance. But he also showed me just how
   far this could take him into self·destruction'
18 Compare the attacks on pseudo·intellectualism and Eastern religions that
   Chabrol makes in Les Biches, Que la Mte meure and Le Boucher.
                                                  CHABROL AND FRIENDS               9

    Chabrol's frequenting of film clubs in his youth opened him
up to a less controversial but equally crucial influence: the cinema
ofFritz Lang and Alfred Hitchcock. It was Lang's The Testament of
Dr Mabuse, made in 1933 and seen by Chabrol in Paris after the
war, that inspired him to become a film-maker. Lang has remain-
ed one of Chabrol's heroes, and in 1976 he dedicated Alice ou la
derniere fugue to the dying German director. What Chabrollearned
from Lang's cinema was the use of dispassionate, objective camera-
work to evoke the theme of fate, and the importance of express-
ionist mise en scene - in other words, the manipulation of decor
and objects to convey atmosphere and meaning. As Chabrol
explains, in Lang's expressionism 'On devrait comprendre de quoi
il s'agit, meme s'il y avait une chaise a. la place de l'acteur'I9
(Chabrol 1976:120). In contrast with Lang, Hitchcock uses the
subjective camera (the point-of-view shot) to realise the more
intimate themes of voyeurism, guilt and innocence, and to
generate a complicity between the spectator and the narrative: 'Par
principe, par definition, il n'y a chez Lang aucune subjectivite,
alors que chez Hitchcock, des les premiers films realises en
Amerique, presque tous les plans sont faits du point de vue d'un
personnage, tantot l'un, tantot l'autre, puis intervient l'objectivite,
c'est-a.-dire la subjectivite du spectateur'20 (ibid.: 133-4). Like Lang,
however, Hitchcock has been a recurrent influence on Chabrol's
thinking about cinema, from the book on Hitchcock that he co-
wrote with Eric Rohmer in 1957 to the use of subjective camera
and voyeurism in his own work. The influences of Lang and
Hitchcock are especially recognisable in certain films and in
certain periods ofChabrol's career. Hence the Langian style of Les
Biches, Que la bete meure and the films of the 1970s, and also of Dr
M in 1989 (in some ways a remake of Lang's Mabuse series).
While the 1960s thrillers L'CBU du malin and La Femme inftdele

19 'You should be able to understand what it's all about even if the actor was
   replaced by a chair'
20 'On principle, by definition, there is no subjectivity in lang, while in Hitchcock,
   from his first American fIlms onwards, almost every shot is fIlmed from the
   point of view of one character or another. Then objectivity - that's to say, the
   spectator's subjectivity - intervenes'
10    CLAUDE CHABROl


both owe a clear debt to Hitchcock, Chabrol's main Hitchcockian
period dates from 1986 and Masques, a mm littered with seventeen
references to the 'Master of Suspense',>· By 1995 and La Cere-
monie, Chabrol could declare:' A un moment j'etais tres langien ...
Je crois qu'avec l'age on devient hitchcockien'" (Guerin and Jousse
1995: 30). However, Chabrol's understanding ofLang and Hitch-
cock most frequently results in a productive tension between their
two legacies - between expressionism and voyeurism, objective
camera and subjective camera, fate and personal responsibility.
    Probably the most important lesson that Chabrollearned from
the example of Lang and Hitchcock was that a mm-maker's
personal vision need not be incompatible with the demands of
genre cinema. Lang and Hitchcock worked throughout their
careers in popular genres, predominantly the thriller, but also the
western and the fantasy mm (Lang), the comedy and the
melodrama (Hitchcock). Ironically, and cruelly for ChabroI. while
in the 1950S the critics on Cahiers du cinema (himself included)
were able to reassess Lang and Hitchock's artistic status by
observing that a great auteur could work within genre cinema, in
the 1960s this point seemed to be forgotten in the widespread
condemnation (led by Cahiers) ofChabrol's fall from artistic grace
into the spy mm and the popular thriller. This irony is also
symptomatic ofChabrol's general relationship with the new wave
- a movement which he helped to create, and which was quick to
reject him - as we shall see in the next chapter.

The new wave



Chabrol has excellent new-wave credentials and is in some ways a
representative figure for this innovative movement in French
cinema. A film fan from an early age, he ran a film club in the
village of Sardent (to which he had been evacuated from Paris
during the Second World War). On his return to the capital, he
frequented student film clubs where he met the future new-wave
directors Fran~ois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer and
Jacques Rivette. Like them, he venerated Hollywood cinema,
wrote film criticism for Cahiers du cinema in the 195os, and shot
his first films at the end of the decade. He collaborated with
Rohmer on a study of Hitchcock, and with Truffaut and Godard
on the latter's film A bout de sou.ffle (1959). But there are also
several ways in which Chabrol contradicts the new-wave model.
His account of A bout de sou.ffle suggests that Godard took over the
project because Chabrol and Truffaut were at odds with each other
(Chabrol 1976: 137). Unlike the others, Chabrol had some experi-
ence of the film industry from within, having worked as press
officer for the American studio Fox. Whereas his colleagues tended
to work for other directors or to experiment with short films
before trying their first feature, Chabrol's first venture in film-
making was the feature-length (and commercially successful) Le
Beau Serge. The film was financed by Chabrol himself, using his
first wife's family inheritance. His company, AJYM, produced
several early new-wave films, including Le Beau Serge and Les
Cousins (both 1958), but also Jacques Rivette's Le Coup du berger

(1956), Eric Rohmer's Le Signe du lion (1958) and Jacques
Gaillard's La Ligne droite (1961). Despite the financial support he
gave his colleagues, Chabrol has stated that the supposed solid-
arity and coherence of the group was just a myth - as in the case of
A bout de sou.fJle - and that the new wave was never an artistic
movement like, say, surrealism. In fact, the marketing of the new
wave in the late 1950S struck him as cynical and manipulative:
'Entre 1958 et 1959, les copains des Cahiers et moi, passes a la
realisation, avons ete promus comme une marque de savonnette.
Nous etions la "nouvelle vague" .... si la grande presse a tant parle
de nous, c'est qu'on voulait imposer l'equation: de Gaulle egale
Renouveau. Dans le cinema comme ailleurs. Le general arrive, la
Republique change, la France renait" (ibid.: 135). None the less,
Chabrol's first half a dozen films can be defined as his new wave
period, featuring as they do several characteristics of nouvelle
vague cinema: the filming of one's own scripts, a preference for
shooting on location rather than in the studio, a degree of formal
experimentation, an interest in neorealism, and some reliance on
popular genres such as the melodrama and the thriller.



Le Beau Serge
To make his first film, Chabrol returned to the scene of his
wartime childhood, the village of Sardent in central France. The
reason for this was mainly financial: he had intended to shoot Les
Cousins first, but that story was set in Paris and would have been
twice as expensive to film. For the small budget of 32 million old
francs, he was able to shoot Le Beau Serge (1958) over nine weeks
in the winter of 1957/8, and to film it in what was essentially his
home village (several generations of Chabrol's family had come
 I   'Between 1958 and 1959, me and my friends on Cahiers, once we'd gone into
     film directing. were promoted like a brand of soap. We were the "new wave". If
     the daily papers talked about us so much. it was only because they wanted to
     establish the idea that de Gaulle equals Renewal. In the cinema as elsewhere.

     Charles de Gaulle was elected president of France and inaugurated the Fifth
     Republic.)

from Sardent). The village is a crucial backdrop to the narrative
and also provides extras and minor characters, such as the baker
 Michel Creuse. Le Beau Serge is most notable for its realistic setting
and for the autobiographical elements within it. The latter include
a religious message (Chabrol was at this time a practising Catholic),
the death of a baby (which he and his wife had experienced), and
above all the central theme of a Parisian student returning to his
provincial roots. The clash of personalities between Frans:ois (Jean-
Claude Brialy), the convalescent student returning from Paris,
and his old friend Serge (Gerard Blain), a local boy who has stayed
in the village, stuck in the rut of poverty and alcoholism, also
heralds the power struggles between the Charles and Paul characters
that were to appear in Les Cousins and again in the HeUme cycle.
    Originally, the finished film ran to two hours and thirty-five
minutes, before Chabrol cut many of the scenes of village life,
reducing it to the standard hour and a half. He later regretted
losing this quasi-documentary footage, but even so, many critics
saw - and praised - Le Beau Serge as a neorealist work. Established
in postwar Italy, and extremely influential on the cinema of the
new wave, neorealism has been defined according to the following
principles: 'Un message, actualite du scenario, sens du detail, sens
des foules, realisme, verite de l'acteur, verite des decors, verite des
eclairages, photographie de style reportage, camera tn!s libre"
(Martin 1975: 34)· Neorealist films tend to be characterised by
'location shooting, lengthy takes, unobtrusive editing, natural
lighting, a predominance of medium and long shots, respect for
the continuity of time and space, use of contemporary, true-to-life
subjects, an uncontrived, open-ended plot, working-class prota-
gonists, a nonprofessional cast, dialogue in the vernacular, active
viewer involvement, and implied social criticism' (Marcus 1986:
22). Although Chabrol's later work was to deviate far from this
model (particularly via the use of sophisticated editing, formal
construction, stylised colour and expressionist mise en scene), Le
Beau Serge sticks to it pretty closely. Where it differs most clearly is

 2   'A message. a contemporary screenplay. a grasp of detail, a grasp of the masses,
     realism. truth in the acting, the decor and the lighting, reportage·style photo·
     graphy. and very free camerawork'

in its middle-class protagonist, Franltois, and in its (his) contrived
plot to bring about Serge's salvation. Any social criticism implied
by the film is in this way submitted to a religious message, and the
result is moralistic rather than political. However, as we shall see
shortly, the ending of Chabrol's film is perhaps more open-ended
and ambivalent than first appears.
    Despite the vivacity of the camerawork and the occasional
lyricism of the setting, Le Beau Serge is rather a schematic film.
This is because ofChabrol's religious convictions, which permeate
not just the characterisation, but also the composition of indivi-
dual shots and the themes of Emile Delpierre's score. In his
positive review of the film for Arts magazine, Truffaut called it
'une partie de dames jouee par deux jeunes hommes, Gerard
Blain le pion noir, et Jean-Claude Brialy le pion blanc. Au moment
precis ou les deux se rencontrent, ils changent de couleur et
gagnent ex-aequo') (Truffaut 1958: 54). Truffaut's perceptive first
comment is certainly borne out by the characterisation of 'bad'
Serge (associated with black) and 'good' Franltois (associated with
white). But his conclusion seems a little generous and is not
shared by Chabrol. He speaks instead of a heavy-handed symbol-
ism (Braucourt 1971: IIZ), which is evident from the very start of
the film, and which reaches its pitch at the end. In the opening
scene, Franltois arrives by bus in the village square. As the camera
(mounted on top of the bus) pans to one side to reveal Serge and
his father-in-law Glomaud, both drunk, a sudden burst of music
emphasises the threat posed by these characters to the innocent
newcomer. Throughout the film, distinct musical themes are
used to characterise Franltois (bright, lyrical strings and flutes)
and Serge (ominous, rumbling brass and drums). When Franltois
runs round the village like a child, it is to the sound of flutes;4
when Serge, like a drunken ogre, chases the schoolchildren from
the square, it is to the sound of drums. On their second meeting,

4 The flutes are also associated with the schoolchildren, whose innocence and
  goodness Fran~ois apparently shares.
16    CLAUDE CHABROl


when the two friends embrace, their musical motifs are mingled
before the lyrical, optimistic theme wins out (a microcosm of the
narrative itself). The categorisation of 'good' Fram;:ois and 'bad'
Serge is mirrored by that of the female characters, the long-suffer-
ing Yvonne (Serge's wife) and her promiscuous younger sister
Marie. As Truffaut suggests, colour is used symbolically in the
film, for the women as well as the men. This results in a mise en
scene which, although not always formulaic, does at times seem
heavily allegorical. For instance, when Fran~ois visits Serge's
house for breakfast, the 'bad' pair (Serge and Yvonne) are grouped
on the left of the frame and the 'good' pair (Fran~ois and Marie) on
the right. Both sisters are standing, both men sitting at the table.
Dressed in white, Marie holds a bottle of milk (signifying her
maternal role and also Fran~ois's childlike innocence), while
Yvonne, dressed in a dark dress, hands a dark bottle of wine to the
alcoholic Serge. While Marie pours milk into Fran~ois's coffee
bowl, Serge pours wine into his. 5
    The tension between good and evil, the clashing of opposite
personalities, and the over-dramatic score all lend Le Beau Serge an
air of melodrama which it shares with several ofChabrol's films,6
and which is also present in some Italian neorealism. But a degree
of ambivalence also becomes apparent as the struggle between
Fran~ois and Serge develops. Serge may be equated with the
stagnant village pond (which, he says, should be cleaned out, emp-
tied, and started again), but Fran~ois's mission to cleanse his old
friend is not always presented as an unequivocally good thing.
Marie tells him 'Tu as l'air de nous regarder comme si on etait des
insectes - tu n'aimes personne'.7 The emphasis placed on Fran-
~ois's voyeurism (we often see him looking at other characters,
sometimes from the elevated safety of his hotel-room window)
associates him with many ofChabrol's later anti-heroes, including
Albin in L'(EU du malin and Forestier in Le Cri du hibou. (It also
positions him as a kind of alter ego for Chabrol, an outsider in his

   categorical: Serge is wearing white in this scene, and Fran~ois black.

own village, an intellectual returning to Sardent to let his camera
record village life with a documentarist's curiosity.) Like Albin and
 Forestier, Franc;:ois is in many ways an interloper, an intruder who
disturbs the natural order, spreading discord wherever he goes.
This is most evident when he tells Glomaud what the whole village
knows but has never admitted: that Marie is not his daughter.
When Glomaud proceeds to rape her, Franc;:ois, rather than blame
himself, dismisses the villagers as 'animals' beyond redemption.
His plan to save Serge, meanwhile, involves breaking up his
marriage with Yvonne (despite the fact that she is pregnant), and
soon alienates all those around him. He is told by Yvonne that
Serge has become even more unhappy since his arrival. (The
original reason for Serge's despairing alcoholism is the death of
his handicapped baby son.) Eventually all the villagers, including
the maternal landlady, tell him to leave. And yet the film ends with
an apparently triumphant portrayal of Franc;:ois's efforts to save
the village, to give them a Christ-like example, and to redeem the
principal sinner, Serge, by dragging him through the snow to
witness the birth of his (healthy) child.
    It is this moralising conclusion, complete with symbols of
crosses and the martyrdom of Franc;:ois, which Chabrol now dis-
owns, and which sets Le Beau Serge apart from the rest of his work,
where there are few value judgements and where the endings are
resolutely ambivalent. The key is provided by Chabrol's Catholic
faith at the time he made the film, and by his subsequent loss of
faith. As he explains, Le Beau Serge 'm'a completement dechris-
tianise. J'avais surcharge ce film de tout un symbolique imbecile.
Il fallait le faire pour que j'en sois debarasse. Maintenant, c'est
fini'8 (Braucourt 1971: II2-13). Chabrol remains vague as to
exactly when his crisis of faith took place: 'J' etais chretien dans le
temps, j'ai cesse de I'Hre entre 1957 et 1959'9 (ibid.). This begs the
question, when exactly did Chabrol lose his religion? Was it
actually during the making of Le Beau Serge (winter 1957/8)? And
if not, was the crisis not at least signalled (unconsciously) in the

18    ClAUDE CHABROL


final section of the film? One thinks of Chabrol's assessment of
 Balzac as a novelist whose work has a meaning completely opposed
to his conscious intentions: '11 a dit qu'il ecrivait a la lumiere de
deux fIambeaux, l'Eglise et la Royaute. De conviction, il est vrai
qu'il etait monarchiste et catholique. En meme temps, ce qu'il
ecrit dame le contraire'(O (Chabrol 1976: 346). The same could be
said of Chabrol and Le Beau Serge - the film in fact deconstructs
and lays bare (as a comforting illusion) the moralising Catholi-
cism it ostensibly celebrates.
    If this is so, the canonical reading of the film (which Chabrol
shares) is undermined by a second interpretation. The first might
be said to be the conscious reading, the second the 'dream
reading'." According to the dream reading, the final twenty minu-
tes or so of Le Beau Serge would be Fran~ois's subjective fantasy."
The main due to this possibility is the dreamlike mise en scene of
the condusion, and in particular the fairytale atmosphere evoked
by the falling snow. After he is beaten up by Serge at the village
dance, and rejected by the entire village, Fran~ois is confronted
with the image of a cross (in fact the frame of a window), the first
of many in the dosing scenes. He returns to his hotel room, where
the landlady appears and advises him to leave Sardent once and
for all. In response he leans his battered face against the door of
his room and mumbles 'Non'. The beautiful image that follows
suggests that we are passing from bleak neorealism into comfort-
ing fantasy: while Fran~ois's face remains in dose-up (providing
the anchor for the subjective scenes to come), Chabrol super-
imposes onto it a shot of swirling snowflakes. The effect is as if
Fran~ois has entered a dreamland, a childhood of the mind where
he becomes the Christian saviour he has longed to be, and where,
like an affronted child, he finally gets to 'show' everyone who
doubted or rejected him. In the next shot, the village is covered in
10 'He said that he wrote by the light of two flames, the Church and the monarchy.
   It is true that, by conviction, he was a monarchist and a Catholic. But at the same
   time, what he wrote proclaims the opposite'
11 The term 'dream reading' is taken from Chris Marker's superb reinterpretation
   of Hitchcock's Vertigo, according to which 'the entire second part would be
   nothing but a fantasy' (Marker 1995= 126).
12 Two critics have suggested as much (Magny 1987: 83'5, Blanche! 1989: 17).

snow and young children are going to school. Gentle music is
heard as we are given Fran~ois's view of the village from his
window. Whether he has really woken or is dreaming, whether he
in fact leaves his bed or remains in it, fantasising as he lies dying,
all that follows conforms to his wish for martyrdom. Telling the
priest that the villagers need his help, Fran~ois goes out for the
first time in a fortnight. He is reconciled with Yvonne. Then, in
the night, he is told that she is in labour. Disregarding his own
weak health, he runs through the snow, first to find the doctor and
then to look for Serge. like Father Logan in Hitchcock's I Confess
(1953), he embarks on a physical journey which parallels the
stations of the cross.Ij At each stage of his journey, Fran~ois is met
by crosses: the window frame at Glomaud's house (where he finds
the doctor), the fence by the hen-coop (where he eventually finds
Serge, in an alcoholic stupor) the door and window frames of
Yvonne's house (where he drags Serge in time for the birth). As he
searches for Serge in the snow, the light from his torch throws a
halo around him. And when he finally collapses, having engin-
eered Serge's redemption, his final words are Tai cru'.14 Every-
thing seems to have been resolved through his powers of faith - or,
if one chooses the dream reading, through his powers of fantasy.'l



Les Cousins
At the last minute, Le Beau Serge was pulled as the official French
entry for the 1958 Cannes film festival. Even so, Chabrol showed
the film outside the competition, where it was well received, and
he managed to sell it to one or two foreign distributors. He was
now in a position to shoot Les Cousins (1958) in Paris as he had
wanted (at a cost of 62 million old francs). The film tells how

15 The ominous music, Serge's mad laughter, and the blurred close-up on his

   good' ending_
20    CLAUDE CHABROL


Charles, a provincial law student (Gerard Blain), stays With his
Parisian cousin Paul (Jean-Claude Brialy). Cynical and charisma·
tic, Paul parties hard, cheats at his law exams, and seduces Florence,
with whom his cousin had fallen in love. Under the strain, the
'good' Charles (who works hard but fails) is tempted to murder his
cousin, but cannot even manage that. The next morning, Paul kills
Charles accidentally with the loaded gun intended for him. Where
 Le Beau Serge attracted seventy thousand spectators in Paris, Les
 Cousins was seen by over two hundred and fifty thousand (Brau-
court 1971: 177). The new wave was taking off, and Chabrol was in
the vanguard. The reception of Les Cousins was, however, in one
way problematic - and was a sign of things to come for Chabrol.
    Les Cousins deviates from neorealism in ways that Le Beau Serge
does not. For instance, contrary to neorealism's long takes and
unobtrusive editing, Les Cousins features a bravura sequence of
fast editing, a new-wave celebration of Parisian landmarks seen
from a speeding car (comparable to a similar sequence in Godard's
A bout de soulJle). None the less, Chabrol's second film does also
have a realistic setting: the Latin Quarter, and in particular the so-
called 'capo de droit' run by Parisian law students. But while
critics had been quick to praise Chabrol's portrayal of Sardent as
completely naturalistic, there was a certain reluctance to acknow-
ledge the accuracy of his view of student Paris. Les Cousins was in
fact based on Chabrol's own experiences at the 'capo de droit'
between 1947 and 1949. One of the very few left-wingers to be
welcomed by the group (apparently because of his sense of
humour), Chabrol witnessed their flirtations with Fascist ideology,
and the charismatic presence of their leader, a certain Jean-Marie
Le Pen.'6 The rationale for the film was therefore, among other
things, to show the dangerous appeal of Fascism. (One could also
say that it dramatises the dangerous appeal of Chabrol's friend
and the film's co-writer, Paul Gegauff.) As Chabrol discovered,
although Les Cousins was a great commercial success, it was the
first of his films to be totally misunderstood by some critics: 'Les
gens, a l'epoque, ne croyaient pas qu'il y avait des fascistes en
France. C'est aussi bete que cela. Ils ont donc cru que c'etait moi le

fasciste, puisqu'ils ne voulaient pas croire que c'etait ceux qu'ils
voyaient sur l'ecran'I7 (Collet and Tavernier 1962.: 7). Although
Chabrol's point was proved by events of the early 1960s (such as
the putsch of 1961 and the activities of the OAS - Organisation de
l'arrnee secrete - terrorists), the 'Fascist' tag unfortunately stuck
long enough to dominate the critical reception of Les Bonnes
Femmes in 1960 (see p. 2.8).
    The narrative of us Cousins reworks the fable of the town
mouse and the country mouse. But it is also derived from the
novels of Balzac, especially the rites of pas3age faced by Rastignac
in Le Pere Gorlot. like Charles, Rastignac is a provincial law student,
devoted to his mother, eager to make his way in Paris, and in
many ways repulsed by the cynical society he finds there. But
where Charles turns inwards and destroys himself, Rastignac
adapts to the unpleasant realities of his new environment. A
similar story is told in Les Illusions perdues, the Balzac novel which
Charles is given by the bookseller and which he refuses to read (he
has lost his own illusions by himself at the end of the film). The
parallel with Balzac is not just limited to the narrative, however.
Les Cousins, co-written by Gegauff, sees the introduction of the
Charles and Paul characters (and, in Florence, a prototype HeIene)
which were to recur in the Helene cycle of the late 1960s and early
1970s. Balzac himself had, in the early 1830s, toyed with the idea
of using the same initials or first names for characters in different
works. From 1832. onwards, he went further, and certain charac-
ters appeared and reappeared in various novels. The intention
behind this - to create a huge, coherent whole out of numerous
smaller works - is echoed by Chabrol's films from Les Cousins on-
wards (and, in microcosm, by the Helene cycle). In his auto-
biography Chabrol describes Balzac's Comedie humaine as a giant
mosaic, where the whole is more important than any constituent
part, before adding: 'En toute modestie, c'est ma demarche ... Il
n'est pas indispensable que chacun de mes films soit considere
comme parfait. 11 se peut que j'aie seulement voulu illustrer une

17 'At the time, people didn't believe that there were Fascists in France. It was as
   stupid as that. So they thought that I was a Fascist, because they didn't want to

 idee qui etait apparue dans un film et que je reprendrai. Ce que je
 cherche c'est que l'ensemble de mes realisations donne une idee
 tres precise d'une vision des choses'18 (Chabrol 1976 : 347).
    Where Les Cousins suggest the Chabrolian vision much more
 clearly than Le Beau Serge is in the ambivalence of the character-
 isation and in the detailed exploration of power relations (usually
expressed spatially). The 'good' and 'bad' roles from the first film
are resurrected in the second only to be more strongly challenged.
 In this case, Charles is not only innocent, diligent and well-mean-
ing, he is also naive, over-idealistic and puritanical. On several
occasions he actually rejects Florence so that he can keep studying
for his exams. Paul, meanwhile, although manipulative, egocen-
tric and cynical, is also a fun-loving pragmatist (in this he actually
ressembles Chabrol as well as Gegauff). As Florence's choice
suggests, Paul is sexually more magnetic than the inhibited and
rather adolescent Charles. And, in the final analysis, while Charles
tries to murder Paul, the latter is quite possibly in love with the
former, and is certainly grief-stricken by his death (see below, p.
24). The interrelations between the two cousins (and Florence) are
expressed spatially, but without any of the religious or moral
symbolism that weighed down Le Beau Serge. In Us Cousins,
spatial compositions express power rather than morality.'9 Unsur-
prisingly, the power tends to belong to Paul. This is best revealed
in two sequences showing Charles entering Paul's apartment in
Neuilly. On his first arrival, he finds his cousin on top of a ladder
looking through a telescope. Naturally enough, Paul looks down at
Charles, who has to look up to him. The construction is realistic,
but also symbolic - a lesson learned from Lang's expressionism.
The second example is even more explicit, since Chabrol shows
two levels of the apartment in a single shot, to emphasise the

18 'In all modesty, that's also my approach. It's not vital for each of my films to be
   considered perfect. I might only have wanted to illustrate an idea that had
   appeared in a previous film, and that I'll take up again later. What I'm after is
   that my films as a whole give a very precise idea of a personal vision.' (This is
   probably Chabrol's most auteurist statement to date.)
19 The power relations in Juste avant la nuit (1971), Les Innocents aux mains sales
   (1975) and La Ceremonie (1995) are similarly expressed by open· plan decors and
   spatial compositions. See Chapters 3, 4 ' and 7 respectively.
                                                       THE NEW WAVE           23


characters' respective positions. Having failed to meet Florence at
the university, Charles returns to Neuilly, where he finds her
together with Paul. The new couple are on the first floor, while
Charles is framed on the ground floor, beneath them. A similarly
expressive composition a little later - once Florence has moved
in with Paul - shows her sunbathing topless in the bay of a
window, with Charles standing, again, beneath her. Her idealised,
unattainable status in his eyes is expressed not just by the spatial
relation between them, but by the railings which literally bar his
view of her body. In the closing stages of the film, Charles's
inability to mentally shut out Paul and Florence is reflected
visually by their ubiquitous presence behind the frosted glass
doors of his study (either partying in the living-room or showering
together in the bathroom). In short, the apartment becomes an
expression of Charles's state of mind. And while Paul and
Florence (and their numerous friends) use the open living-room,
Charles himself remains closed off, isolated, unable actually to
live (hence unable to enter the living-space).
     Similarly, the mise en scene expresses Paul's embryonic Fascism.
The decor of the apartment - the ranks of toy soldiers seen in the
first shot, the trophies and guns on the wall - suggests a fascin-
ation with military power and with stylised violence. Emphasis is
placed on the pistol which Paul, Charles and the Italian count all
play with, and which is ultimately loaded by Charles with fatal
consequences. (There is a similar emphasis on the decor of
Frederique's villa, with the dagger on the wall, in Les Biches (1967),
Les Cousins's sister film). Since German culture is actually used
in Les Cousins as a shorthand for Paul's leanings towards Fascism,
it is no surprise to see candlelight and huge shadows - associated
with German expressionism - in the sequence where Paul, wear-
ing a Nazi officer's cap, wanders through the party reading Goethe
in German to the strains of Wagner's Gotterdammerung.'o The
precise piece of music used here is worth noting. Paul puts on the

20 Compare Chabrol's first meeting with Gegauff (see Chapter I, p. 72). It should
   perhaps be noted that it was Chabrol and not Gegauffwho devised the scene
   where the Jewish student is awoken by Paul shouting that the Gestapo are
   coming (see Collet and Tavemier 1962: 7).
24     CLAUDE CHABROL


'Death of Siegfried', an apparently apt choice for the recital of a
poem about the death of a soldier. But the music has other
connotations within the narrative, as the end of the scene reveals.
As the music reaches its poignant close, Paul repeats the last line
of the poem - 'love is born' - while staring despondently at
Charles and Florence, who have just begun to kiss. There is a
suggestion here (via the music and the poem) that Paul is mourn·
ing the birth of Charles's love for Florence, and hence the death of
a possible love between the two cousins. This implicit theme -
Paul's love for Charles - is reiterated by the film's brilliant ending,
which first sees the complete destruction of Charles's identity (his
failure at the exams, his virtual suicide when he throws his
student card and notes into the Seine, his half-hearted attempt to
kill Paul by a kind of Russian roulette) and then his accidental
shooting by Paul. Again, Wagner's music evokes the death oflove,
this time literally (the piece is the Liebestod from Tristan und
Isolde).2I As the music reaches its crescendo, Charles falls dead at
Paul's feet. The closing cadences drift away as Paul sits, stunned,
by his cousin's body and realises what has happened. The
Liebestod expresses his own mourning for Charles's death as
much as Isolde's for Tristan's. Someone rings at the door, and
while the music fades to silence and Paul goes to confront the
future, a slow camera movement reveals the record-player. The

During the making of Les Cousins, Chabrol met Stephane Audran
(she plays the part of Fran~oise, one of Paul's friends). His
relationship with his first wife, Agnes, was in disarray. Theyeven-
tually divorced, and Chabrol married Audran in 1964. AJYM
Films, the production company Chabrol had set up with Agnes's
inheritance, was wound up in the early 1960s. The commercial
pressures associated with making films for producers other than
21   Liebestod means 'love's death'. In the opera, Tristan dies from a wound only
     Isolde can heal. On hearing of his death, she dies of a broken heart.

himself were about to become a determining factor in the
development of Chabrol's career. At first, there were no problems.
The Hakim brothers financed his third film, allowing him not
only to shoot the flashbacks he wanted, but also to film in colour -
the other producers he approached had granted him one or the
other but not both! The first of Chabrol's many adaptations of crime
novels, A double tour (1959) was carefully constructed so that
'c'etait le recit lui-meme qui faisait un double tour. En outre,
j'avais tourne avec beaucoup de mouvements circulaires. Le film
devait representer un cercle qui se dedouble sur lui-meme'"
(Chabrol 1976: 152). A double flashback was used, so that 'Le
premier raconte ce qui s'est passe un peu plus tot, le second
raconte ce qui s'est passe pendant le premier'2l (Collet and
Tavernier 1962: 8). This attention to structure was only partly
successful - 'C'etait tres construit, mais les gens ont cru que c;:a
allait dans tous les sens'24 (ibid.) - and was to be even more invol-
ved and even less understood in Chabrol's controversial fourth
film, Les Bonnes Femmes (1960).
    Despite the relative failure of A double tour at the box office (it
cost twice as much as Les Cousins, but attracted only half the
number of spectators), the Hakim brothers were prepared to
finance Chabrol's next film - probably, he explains, because they
thought from the title that Les Bonnes Femmes would be some kind
of sex comedy (Chabrol 1976: 152). To the disappointment of
almost everybody, it was nothing of the sort. Instead, the film
painted a bleak picture of the boredom and alienation of four shop
assistants, each of whom struggles to break out of her environ-
ment but fails, and one of whom is ultimately murdered. With a
subtlety he had not shown before, Chabrol mixed together two
distinct elements in an unsettling synthesis: neorealism and
thriller, tedium and suspense, banality and menace. These strands
are reflected by Pierre Jansen's score: by turns wistful and lyrical,
22 'it was the story itself which went round twice. What's more, I included lots of
   circular camera movements. The film was meant to represent a circle which
   doubled back on itself
23 'The first one shows what happened a little earlier, and the second one shows
   what happened during the first one'
24 'It was very structured, but people thought it was all over the place'

in neorealist style (evoking the girls' frustrated dreams), and
suspenseful and dark, as in a thriller (for the appearances of the
mysterious motorcyclist). Chabrol and Gegauff also gave the film
an intricate structure, made up of different episodes to reflect the
comings and goings of the characters. The result was, according to
Chabrol, a heptahedron (ibid.: 195). In other words, the film corn·
prises seven sections;5 identifiable as follows:
1    Jane (Bernadette Laffont) goes to a nightclub with Albert and
     Marcel and then back to their flat for sex;·6
2    Rita (Lucile Saint-Simon) goes with the others to a restaurant,
     where she meets her fiance Henri;
3    the four girls go to the zoo together;
4    Ginette (Stephane Audran) is discovered by the others singing
     at a music-hall;
5    they all go to the swimming-pool, where Albert and Marcel
     reappear;
6    Jacqueline (Clotilde Joano) finally goes on a date with Andre,
     the motorcyclist, and is murdered by him in the woods;
7    in a cryptic coda, a fifth, unnamed bonne femme is introduced,
     dancing at a nightclub with a man whose face we do not see.
Each of the four young women (and by implication, the fifth) thus
seeks a different route out of their situation: sex and a good time,
marriage into the bourgeoisie, a theatrical career, romance. The
only one who escapes is Jacqueline, and she does so not through
romance but through death.
   The neorealist depiction of Paris in the film - the scenes in the
metro, the swimming-pool, the music-hall, and above all the
nightclub, where the camera-work is so free and shaky as to
suggest hastily snatched documentary footage - is complemented
by the pacing of the narrative. There are long sequences where
screen time and real time are one, and where nothing happens,
slowly. The evocation of durie (the duration of time) is a trait of

25 Discounting the two 'empty' periods of time when all four girls are shown
   working in the shop.
26 Jacqueline is also present for the first half of the episode. The sex is implied but
   not actually shown.

neorealist cinema - 'substituant aux temps "dramatiques" du
cinema traditionnel des temps faibles ou des temps morts"7
(Martin 1975: 35) - but it can also imply suspense in a thriller
context. The thriller element is provided here by the repeated
appearances of Andre spying on the girls, by the equation between
him and the dangerous tiger made during the zoo sequence, and
by Madame Louise's revelation to Jacqueline of her 'fetish' (not
the romantic lucky charm one expects, but a handkerchief soaked
in the blood of the guillotined serial killer Weidmann).'s Con-
sequently, in Les Bonnes Femmes time is both undramatic and
dramatic, monotonous but (increasingly) suspenseful. The banal-
ity, the repetition, the waiting (especially in the shop sequences,
where the girls wait for it to be time to go home) all beg the
question, when is something filmic going to happen? By feeling
this, the spectator is implicated in Jacqueline's murder, either as
perpetrator (by wanting something to happen to one of the girls)
or in the Hitchockian sense, as victim (identifying with her,
feeling suspense and fear that something will happen to her).
When Jacqueline's murder finally takes place, it is like a parody of
romance. The long·awaited date with Andre is heavy with roman-
tic expectation (both on the part of Jacqueline and, in all proba-
bility, the spectator). A drive in the countryside, lunch in a
restaurant, and then a quiet walk in the woods ... But Andre is not
the romantic hero he appears to be in the swimming-pool scene
(where he rescues Jacqueline from Albert and Marcel). He is
closer to the macabre Madame Louise. There are hints at his real
motive when he praises Jacqueline's long and slender neck, but
the possibilities - romance or death - are balanced against each
other until the murder has been committed. Thus there are
repeated facial close-ups (associated with the filmic representation
of sex), and we see the two lying down together in the bushes. It is
only when Andre climbs offJacqueline's inert body that it becomes
27 'which replaces the "dramatic" time of traditional cinema with uneventful or
   empty time'
28 Weidmann was a sadistic killer of women (hence the suggestion that I acqueline
   will end up being murdered). He was executed at Versailles in 1939 and some
   women in the crowd dipped their handkerchiefs in his blood (see Collet and
   Tavernier 1962: 12).
28     ClAUDE CHABROl


clear that we have been watching a strangulation rather than a sex
scene.
    Both the formal brilliance and the stark realism of Us Bonnes
 Femmes tended to leave spectators and critics cold. What attracted
attention instead was Chabrol and GegaufPs supposedly cynical
treatment of their inadequate central characters. Infuriatingly for
Chabrol, the tenderness he felt for the four shop assistants and
their attempts to break out of a restricted environment was
completely ignored. The humour in the film was considered to be
cruelty at their expense, although it is mostly directed at the men:
Albert and Marcel the louche pick-up artists; Rita's ludicrous
fiance Henri, who coaches her furiously on culture while she
waits to meet his parents; and the shop owner Monsieur Belin,
who marks Jacqueline's first day at work by giving her a flower
and serenading her, before explaining that all breakages will be
deducted from her wages. There were accusations, particularly
from left-wing commentators, that Les Bonnes Femmes was full of
contempt for its working-class characters, that it was neorealism
emptied of compassion, and even that it was a Fascist film. When
asked in 1962 why the film had been considered Fascistic, Chabrol
replied: 'd'une part, c;a vient sans doute des Cousins, d'autre part,
comme les gens sont eux-memes meprisants, ils croient que moi,
aussi, je meprise"9 (Collet and Tavernier 1962: 12). In fact, as
Chabrol explained, Les Bonnes Femmes was an attempt to portray
the alienating social conditions of the uneducated working class,
and as such could claim to be 'un film profondement marxiste'}O
(ibid.: 10). This is never more clear than in the zoo sequence,
where the girls are shot through barred grilles as they look at the
animals: they too, are living their lives out in a cage.
    Les Bonnes Femmes is perhaps above all a film which explores
spectatorship. For all its (neo)realism, it is aware of itself as a
spectacle, and frequently challenges the audience's expectations
and desires. This gives it a certain new-wave self-consciousness

29 'on the one hand. that's because of [the 'fascist' interpretation of] Les Cousins.
   And also because. since people are themselves contemptuous [of the
   characters], they think they think that [ also feel contempt for them'
30 'A deeply Marxist film'

which is not present in Chabrol's later work. The three central
examples are the stage appearances of Dolly Bell and Ginette, and
the closing scene of the film (the coda). Each scene could be said to
address a different aspect of spectatorship: desire, identification
and judgement. In the nightclub sequence, Chabrol considers the
desire of the audience (both in the club and in the cinema itself) to
see the stripper Dolly Bell. This is heightened by the mise en scene
(the music announcing her imminent appearance, the curtains
veiling the stage), but is denied - at least for the film audience - by
the camera-work, so that when she finally appears, Chabrol cuts to
a reverse-shot, revealing not the stripper but the nightclub audi-
ence, seen from her point of view. The filming of Ginette's
performance at the music-hall (wearing a black wig, and trans-
formed into the supposedly Italian singer 'Angela Torrini') refers
back to the Dolly Bell sequence. But now (because of the narrative,
which has introduced us to Ginette's singing ambitions, and
which implies that she will be mortified if her friends find out),
when we see the music-hall audience from the performer's point
of view, we identifY with Ginette and share her perspective (and
her fears of discovery). Finally, after Jacqueline's murder - in
which the spectator is, as we have seen, at least partly implicated-
Chabrol closes the film with his enigmatic coda. The final shot is
of the unknown young woman staring directly at the camera over
the shoulder of her dancing partner. This look (and the apparent
lack of connection between the coda and the rest of the film) asks
us to conclude on what we have seen. What is our judgement on
the lives of the bonnes femmes? Can we identifY with them? The
lack of point-of-view shot here implies that we might not. Can we
at least empathise? Faced with the banal and sad realism of the
film (and by the gaze of the fifth bonne ftmme) , we are challenged
to make a judgement. As the critical response to the film showed,
the challenge was far too disquieting and difficult for some.
30    CLAUDE CHABROL


L'(fjl du maUn

After Les Bonnes Femmes - only 84,000 tickets sold in Paris -
Chabrol could hardly afford another failure at the box office. In
commercial terms, his career was in free-fall. The situation
worsened with the release of the black comedy Les Godelureaux
 (1960). According to Chabrol, this was a useless film about
uselessness (ibid.: 13). The public obviously agreed: a mere 23,000
watched it. However, the film's producer, Georges de Beauregard
- who went on to finance Landru in 1962 and La Ligne de demar-
cation in 1966 - was not disheartened. He supported Chabrol's
next project, L'(Eil du malin (1961), although the film eventually
had to be shot for half the original (rather modest) budget,
because of problems with the German co-producer. Accepting the
challenge, Chabrol shot the film frugally, mainly in and around
Munich. Luckily, his scenario (written without Gegauff this time)
called for a small cast, very few group shots, and a limited number
of locations. The film was shot quicker and cheaper than any of
Chabrol's work since Le Beau Serge. This may have been of some
consolation when it proved another commercial disaster.
    L'(Eil du malin is narrated throughout by Albin Mercier
(Jacques Charrier). A young French journalist, he is sent on assign-
ment to a village in Bavaria. There he meets a French woman,
Helene Hartmann (Stephane Audran in the first of her 'Helene'
roles), and her husband Andreas (WaIter Reyer), a successful
German writer. Andreas is everything that Albin is not but wants
to be: famous, wealthy, physically and intellectually strong, and
married to the beautiful HeIene. Albin is an outsider in this world,
not only unable to speak German but also placed outside the
apparently idyllic bourgeois lifestyle of the Hartmanns: he is
frequently shown lingering by their wall or gate, looking in at what
he imagines to be 'un univers rond, parfait, OU tout est harmon-
ieux'y Gradually he befriends the couple and enters ever deeper
into their house and their lives. Discovering that HeIene is having
an affair behind Andreas's back, Albin first tries to blackmail her
into leaving her husband. When she refuses, he shows Andreas

31 'a perfect, rounded universe, where everything is in harmony'
                                                        THE NEW WAVE          31


the photos he has taken of the lovers, with the result that Andreas
murders his wife. Albin is again alone, outside the gates, as
Andreas is taken away by the police. He has destroyed the very
harmony that he envied.
     In many ways, L'(Eil du malin is the one ftlm from Chabrol's
new-wave period which best prefigures his later work. Two staple
themes of his mature cinema are presented here: first, the dis-
ruption of an apparently perfect couple to reveal hidden truths and
tensions behind the fa~ade of bourgeois harmony (this recurs in
La Femme infidele, Le Cri du hibou, L' Enfor, and La C6remonie). This
theme is qualified by the second, since the revealer of unwanted
truths, the outsider/avenger figure, is not unequivocally heroic: he
is in many ways destructive, a voyeur whose gaze brings death, a
coward and a manipulator who is afraid to engage fully with life
(hence hiding his real identity and real motives behind masks and
pseudonyms). Thus Andre Mercier (alias Albin) ressembles
Charles Thenier (alias Marc Andrieux) in Que la bete meure, as well
as Wolf in Masques and Forestier in Le Cri du hibou. He may see
through appearances - 'Ainsi, ce bonheur, cette harmonie que
j'enviais, tout n'etait que mensonge et tromperie'P - but he also
engineers their brutal destruction.
    The central motif in the film is of penetration and entry:
specifically, Albin's entry into the Hartmanns' private space (a
metaphor for his sexual desire for Helene and an expression of his
wish to belong). This is reiterated verbally by his commentary -
'j'allais penetrer chez eux'; 'mon but etait de penetrer dans
l'univers de cet couple'; 'je voulais penetrer en fraude'll - and
visually by his gradual exploration of the Hartmanns' home: first
the wall and gate, then the garden, the ground floor of the house
(when invited to dinner), and finally (by a ruse) the first floor,
where the more intimate space of bedroom and bathroom is
found. While Andreas is away on business, Albin assumes his
place in the house: taking a bath, wearing his bathrobe, sitting in

32 'So, the happiness and harmony that 1 had envied was nothing more than lies
   and deceit'
33 'I was going to enter their house'; 'my goal was to enter the universe of this
   couple'; 'I wanted to sneak in secretly'
32     CLAUDE CHABROL


 his chair and drinking his brandy. The sequence ends with his
 triumphant comment (in voice-over), Tetais devenu leur intime'.l"
 But rather than enable him to replace Andreas permanently, as he
 perhaps hopes, Albin's blackmail plan only leaves him alone on
 the outside again. The mise en scene of Helene's murder is worth
dwelling upon. Like the opening sequence of Le Cri du hibou
 (1987), the murder scene recalls the action of watching a film in a
darkened cinema. Albin (like Forestier in Le Cri du hibou) hides in
a dark garden looking up at the well-lit windows of a house. In this
case, Helene staggers out of the house on to the first-floor
veranda, stares into space (towards Albin and the audience) and
then collapses, her throat cut. The equation between Albin and
ourselves (suggested by the composition but also by Helene's
gaze, which addresses both) emphasises that he - like us - has
always been outside looking in, a tolerated voyeur rather than a
true 'intime'.l5
    The first of Chabrol's films to owe a clear debt to Hitchcock,
L'CEi/ du malin reprises the sequence from Vertigo (1958) where
James Stewart, a detective, follows mysterious femme fatale Kim
Novak.3 6 Here, Albin follows Helene to the secret rendez-vous
with her lover. (The camera Albin uses to photograph the two
together recalls another Hitchcockian voyeur, the photographer-
again played by James Stewart - in Rear Window (1954).) As in Les
Bonnes Femmes, during Albin's trailing of Helene the thriller
element is combined with neorealism: on the streets of Munich
and at the beeifest, real crowds jostle the lead characters and
Chabrol's hand-held camera jolts and sways. There is no sound-
track music, only the ambient noise of the festival itself. But the
rest of the film is much more stylised than Les Bonnes Femmes.
This comes from the fact that L'CEil du malin represents Albin's
romanticised account of events rather than an objective, realistic
record. In Chabrol's words. 'L'histoire etait vue par un minable, et


34 "had become intimate with them'
35 'close friend'
36 Vertigo is also alluded to when Albin finds HeIime in the woods. L'Enfer (1994)
   also refers to Vertigo - see Chapter 5.

le film etait forcement, en un sens minable'l7 (ibid.: 14). L'CBi! du
malin is a pathetic film because it is a subjective one. And Albin is
pathetic throughout: in his attempts to enter the Hartmanns'
world and in his petulant revenge on that world when he is
excluded from it (the blackmail plot, but also his desire to avenge
his embarrassment when the Hartmanns discover that he cannot
swim). It is not just the voice-over that indicates Albin's control
over the narrative, and that gives certain events a revised meaning
(exaggerating the Hartmanns' affection for him, insisting on the
duplicity of Helene's affair when the images of it remain light,
natural, almost innocent). At times it is the images too. Hence the
repeated shot of him walking home in the evening from the
Hartmanns' house: 'Lorsqu' Albin Mercier descend la pente en
contre-jour, c'est que, lui, il se voit ainsi. C'est surement le type
qui ne peut pas descendre une pente sans se voir aureole d'un
magnifique contre-jour'l8 (ibid.: 15). One might even ask whether
the penultimate scene, in which Albin begs Andreas's forgive-
ness, is not simply a fantasy, in which Albin says what he should
have said and so absolves himself of the sense of guilt he feels. As
the conclusion suggests, the guilt remains, alongside a newfound
self-awareness. Albin's final voice-over declares, 'Je ne peux pas
m'empecher de raconter cette histoire, et les gens me demandent
pourqui un gan;:on aussi sympathique que moi prend plaisir ase
salir les mains',39 As he has finally realised, and as we have learned
during the telling of the tale, Albin is very far from being 'un
garc;:on sympathique'.4o


37 'The story was seen through the eyes of a pathetic loser, and the film was
   therefore, in one sense, pathetic'
38 'When Albin Mercier is back-lit as he walks down the hill, it's because he sees
   himself like that. He is exactly the sort of person who can't walk down a hill
   without seeing himself basking in the glow of a magnificent light behind him.'
   Compare the romantic images ofFran~ois (lit by haloes) in the closing section of
   Le Beau Serge and of Charles (picked out by melancholy tracking-shots) in the
   central section of Que la belt meure.
39 'I can't stop myself from telling this story, and people ask me why a nice young
   man like me is so keen to wallow in the dirt'
40 There is an added irony here at the expense ofJacques Charrier's star image: his
   usual roles were in fact 'gar~ons sympathiques' (see Chabrol 1976: 159).
34     CLAUDE CHABROL


   Was cam du malin another example - after A double tour and
Les Bonnes Femmes - of Chabrol being too clever for his audience?
 It was certainly another nail in his coffin as a successful new-wave
director. He has said of the film that it ran up against 'une terrible
chose: le fait que le cinema est obligatoirement un art de masse'4 1
 (ibid.: 16). This was to be drummed home with the failure of
 Ophelia (1962), which became Chabrol's fourth consecutive com-
mercial disaster since A double tour. The figures for the Paris box
office reveal a steady and apparently terminal decline: 130,000 for
A double tour, 84,000 for Les Bonnes Femmes, 23,000 for Les
Godelureaux, 14,000 for L'(Bil du malin and 12,000 for Ophelia
(Braucourt 1971: 177).4' The lesson Chabrol was to take out of the
new-wave period was that a director - whether he considered
himself an auteur or not - could not disregard the tastes of the
mass audience and continue to make popular films. The choice
seemed to be between popular cinema (meaning genre cinema)
and the artistic ghetto. It was a dilemma faced by the other new-
wave directors too, and which saw Godard, Rivette and Rohmer
remain in the ghetto with only Truffaut successfully managing to
combine art and commerce. Unlike Truffaut, Chabrol was not yet
in this position, but he was to get there by spending the five years
after Ophe1ia making genre films: the (admittedly macabre) period
drama Landru (1963), the spy films Le Tigre aime la chair fraiche
(1964) and Le Tigre se paifume ala dynamite (1965), the war film La
Ligne de demarcation (1966) and so on. In these wilderness years,
he was rejected by Cahiers du cinema and generally held to be the
disgrace of the new wave. Although new-wave idols like Hitchcock
and Lang, Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks had worked entirely
in popular genres, when Chabrol began to do so he ceased to be
regarded as an auteur.
    Although he was in this way the first to leave the new wave,
Chabrol had made a major contribution to it, first as a critic and
then, more significantly, as both director and producer. There are

41 'a terrible thing: the fact that cinema is by definition an art for mass consump-
   tion'
42 The figures for L'CEil du malin and Les Godelureaux are in fact estimates, since
   the number of entries was not high enough to be computed exactly!
                                                THE NEW WAVE       35

competing views as to which film launched the nouvelle vague -
Agnes Varda's La Pointe courte in 1954, Godard's A bout de souffle
in 1959,Truffaut's Les 400 coups winning at Cannes the same year
- but Le Beau Serge, shown on the fringes at Cannes in 1958 and
hailed by Truffaut that summer as a turning-point in French
cinema, probably has the best claim. In the films that followed,
Chabrol experimented with film form, neorealism, editing and
camerawork, genre and spectatorship in a manner which exem-
plifies new-wave cinema. Ironically, in late 1962 when his new-
wave pedigree was threatened, and in his last Cahiers interview for
twenty years, Chabrol defended the films ofTruffaut and Godard
and called for the nouvelle vague to regroup and work together
again (Collet and Tavernier 1962: 19). The subsequent year did, in
fact, see him working with Godard, each contributing a sketch to
Les plus belles escroqueries du monde (1963). But by this time his
career was in serious jeopardy. Apart from this 18·minute sketch,
Chabrol shot nothing at all between July 1962 and April 1964.
When he did return to film-making, it was no longer as a new-
wave auteur, but as a commercial director of genre films. His way
back into the industry was to be the spy movie Le Tigre aime la
chair fratche.
   The final fling of the new wave was the portmanteau film Paris
vu par ... (1964). It featured six sketches, by directors such as Eric
Rohmer, Jean-Luc Godard and Jean Rouch. Chabrol contributed
what is acknowledged as the best episode of the six, La Muette.
This last, isolated example of Chabrol's new-wave cinema is
sandwiched in his filmography between the commercial spy films
Le Tigre aime la chair frafche and Marie-Chantal contre Dr Kha
(1965). He was now making films for producers who - in
shocking contrast with the new-wave ideal of the self-sufficient
auteur, an ideal he himself had once epitomised - considered
him as their servant (Biette et at. 1982: 9). But Chabrol did not
regard this as a defeat. Rather, he tried to learn from the workings
of popular cinema, and began to question the cult of the self·
penned screenplay: 'il y a des types qui se sentent absolument
honteux d'avoir atoumer le scenario d'un autre. Pourqui pas? <;:a

scenario'4J (ibid.: 10). Four of the seven films that Chabrol was to
make in the aftermath of the new wave - the two Tigres, Le
Scandale (1966) and La Route de Corinthe (1967) - were shot with-
out any contribution to the screenplay from Chabrol or his usual
scriptwriter, Paul Gegauff. But Chabrol deliberately kept his film
crew together during this time, and when he emerged from his
period in artistic exile it was to shoot what are probably the
greatest films of his career, the superb Helene cycle.

The Helene cycle



By the mid-1960s Chabrol had, by his own admission, become the
black sheep of the new wave: 'j'etais la honte, la honte de la
famille" (Biette et al. 1982: 6). His contribution to the movement,
both as producer and director, was eclipsed by the apparently
tawdry spectacle of the commercial films that he made after
Ophe1.ia. The professionalism and expertise that he lavished on spy
films and outrageous thrillers between 1964 and 1967 seemed
merely to confirm that he was no auteur but simply a director for
hire. Yet his period in the wilderness served to develop his tech-
nical skill and his grasp of genres, and led directly to his mature
style in the Heli~ne cycle Of1968-71. None the less, the intellectual
press in France, and in particular Cahiers du cinema, treated even
this flowering of Chabrol's talent with almost as much disdain as
they had shown for the espionage films a few years earlier. The
dominance of Marxist, Maoist and structuralist concerns at
Cahiers du cinema during the late 1960s is largely to blame.
Chabrol's tendency towards classical cinema - in contrast with the
fashionable and more explicitly ideological experimentation of
Resnais, Rivette or Godard - was considered too close to the tradi-
tion de qua/iti (the old-fashioned cinema of quality) that Cahiers
and the new wave had always fought against. As a consequence,
films as important as Les Biches (1967) and La Femme injidele (1968)
were granted barely a page and a half together, while Cahiers did

not interview Chabrol once between 1962 and 1982.' More sur-
prising was the widespread misreading ofChabrol's use ofbour-
geois settings and characters. L'Express, Le Nouvel Observateur and
Cahiers du cinema all remained blind to the sly critique of the
bourgeoisie in films such as Les Biches and La Femme injidele,
choosing instead to detect in Chabrol's work a celebration of the
middle classes. In a review of Que la bete meure (1969) for Le
Nouvel Observateur entitled 'La bouffe et la bagnole' ,3 Michel
Mardore chastised Chabrol for having lost any critical distance on
the bourgeoisie that he once had, and for becoming an apologist
for the status quo. This represents both a breath-takingly wrong-
headed interpretation of Que la bete meure - where, as we shall see,
the ritual of 'la bouffe' is characterised as a torturous experience
while 'la bagnole' is an instrument of death - and a misrepre-
sentation of Chabrol's politics. Similarly oblivious to the ways in
which Chabrol's brand of popular, classical cinema was able to
undermine 'the system' from within, Pascal Kane asked in Cahiers:
'Beaucoup plus victime du "systeme" qu'il ne semble le croire,
Chabrol prendra-t-il un jour ses distances?'4 (Kane 1969: 55). The
political subtext of Les Biches - a film which concerns the possibi-
lity of revolution against the status quo - was either too pessim-
istic to be greeted with approval, or was simply ignored. So too was
Chabrol's contribution to the revolutionary spirit of May 1968,
including Project 4, his radical proposal that cinema entry be free,
uncensored, and paid for by taxation.
    Chabrol's apparent willingness in the mid-196os to compro-
mise the supposed artistic purity and personal vision of the auteur
became evident not just in his pursuit of commercial projects, but
in his acceptance of the constraints of popular genres (spy film,
thriller, melodrama) and in his continuing emphasis on the

collective nature of film-making. He was chastised in Cahiers for
his reliance on generic models, seen as precluding any 'evocation
d'un univers personnel's (ibid.: 55). But Chabrol's fascination with
genre remained, as did his loyalty to his film crew. The team that
he had gathered around him early in his career was kept together
for film after film, year after year, no matter what the project
might be. Jean Rabier's photography, Pierre Jansen's music, and
Jacques Gaillard's editing were thus perfected during the wilder-
ness years in the same way that Chabrol's own directorial style
was. To these were added the continued collaboration with Paul
Gegauff on screenplays, and the increasing importance of Stephane
Audran, alongside actors such as Michel Bouquet, Jean Yanne,
Michel Duchaussoy, Mario David, Henri Attal and Dominique
Zardi. The Helene cycle - strictly speaking, comprising La Femme
infidele, Que la bete meure, Le Boucher, La Rupture and Juste avant la
nuit - sees Audran cast repeatedly in the central role as the often
inscrutable Helene. 6 The principal male roles, mostly incarnated
by Bouquet and Yanne, repeat the contrasting figures of Les
Cousins: the evil but charismatic Paul and the angelic, timid Charles
(parodies of Gegauff and Chabrol respectively). Within the
triangular relationships that result, Chabrol explores questions of
identity, guilt, and class tension, with a degree of precision and
craftsmanship at that point unprecedented in his career.



Les Biches
Chabrol has said that he never felt bitter about his difficulties in
the 1960s, since 'J'ai d'ailleurs toujours pense que ma veritable
carriere commencerait avec la quarantaine'7 (Braucourt 1971: 134).
In 1967, at the age of 37, he found that his prediction was becom-
ing true. Thanks to the support of the young producer Andre
5 'evocation of a personal world-view'
6 The exception here is Que la bite meure, in which Audran does not star. Contrary
  to some accounts, however, there is a Heli~ne in the film, played by Caroline
  Cellier. Les Noces rouges, in which Audran plays the mother of a girl called
  Helene, is in some ways a coda to the cycle, as explained in Chapter 4.

 Genoves - who went on to finance Chabrol's next eleven films -
he was able to shoot Les Biches, 'the first film which I made exactly
as I wished' (Nogueira and Zalaffi 1971: 3). Co-written by Chabrol
and Gegauff, starring Stephane Audran in the lead role, and
 showing the influence of Fritz Lang (in the expressionist decor
and the theme of revenge), Les Biches is the first film of Chabrol's
mature style, and heralds the superb film-making of the Helene
cycle. It concerns the rich and manipulative Frederique (Audran),
who picks up a young pavement artist called Why (Jacqueline
 Sassard) in Paris and takes her home to StTropez. A lesbian affair
develops, but is complicated by the presence of Paul (Jean-Louis
Trintignant), with whom both women fall in love. The uneasy
menage atrois is brutally put to an end when Frederique and Paul
leave for Paris. Why follows, murders Frederique, assumes her
identity, and awaits the arrival of Paul. The film has often been
compared to Les Cousins (1958), since they both explore the power
relations between two friends who are rivals in love. But there are
three crucial differences. In Les Cousins, the rivals are male and
the object of desire female - these gender roles are reversed in Les
 Biches. This allows a portrayal of female sexuality as predatory and
active in the latter film, while it is passive and victimised in the
former. Secondly, and as a result, where Les Cousins is a variant on
the myth of the town mouse and the country mouse, Les Biches is a
variant on the myth of the lesbian vampire. The third distinction is
in the realm of politics: for all the explicit references to Fascism,
Les Cousins does not lend itself to a clear political reading; Les
Biches, on the other hand, can be justly described as a political
film. As Chabrol has said, the subject 'isn't really a power struggle.
It's a revolution: the replacement of one class by another' (Yakir
1979: 9)·
    The first motif to be introduced in Les Biches is the archetype of
the lesbian vampire. Andrea Weiss has noted that 'the typical
lesbian vampire film _.. has certain fairly consistent characteristics:
Gothic themes and images, large empty castles and dark, roman·
tic landscapes, and the arrival, early in the film, of a mysterious,
aristocratic figure' (Weiss 1992: 85). While the Gothic themes and
settings have undergone a modernisation in Chabrol's film, they
46   CLAUDE CHABROL


remain, in modified form: the drama of desire, possession and
murder is played out in Frederique's villa, a contemporary castle
complete with obsequious servants and an array of weapons
 (including the poisoned dagger which Why uses at the end of the
film). More explicitly generic is the characterisation ofFrederique.
She is presented from the first sequence as the typically 'mysteri-
ous, aristocratic' vampire of convention. Chabrol's mise en scene
here is unequivocal. Dressed in black boots, a long black coat and
a black hat, Frederique wanders on to the Pont des Arts, her world-
weary air heightened by her pale make-up and the black kohl
round her eyes. She is looking for a victim. The misty, sepia tones
of the photography here and Pierre Jansen's eerie music unmis-
takably recall the melancholy vampire films of German express-
ionism. More naturalistic colour soon intervenes, but the point
has been made. Even when the film leaves the horror genre (after
the prologue), the relationship between Frederique and Why is
clearly vampiric, centring as it does on the theme of possession,
and the appropriation of one woman by the other. At first it is
Frederique who appropriates Why - she literally buys her body.
But as the narrative develops, Why gradually begins to appropriate
Frederique's clothing, jewellery, voice, sexual pleasure (the bed-
room scene) and, ultimately, her identity. When she kills Frederique
(and puts on the black coat from the first sequence), the vampiris-
ation is complete. To this extent, Les Biches is reminiscent of other
European films of the period, such as Bergman's Persona (1965)
or Fassbinder's The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972), wherein
'vampirism is suggested through the erotic relationship between
two women, in which one woman takes over the personality or
soul of the other' (ibid.). Chabrol's repeated use of mirrored com-
positions, and his close attention to costume in the film, under-
lines this exchange of personalities: as Frederique changes from
lesbian vampire to heterosexual woman, she dresses no longer in
black but in white; Why makes the opposite change, from sexual
innocent (in white) to lesbian vampire (in black). The mise en scene
here would seem to suggest a demonising of lesbianism, in line
with generic conventions: 'The lesbian vampire provokes anxieties
in the heterosexual male spectator, only for the film to quell these
                                            THE HELENE CYCLE       47


anxieties and reaffirm his maleness through the vampire's violent
destruction' (ibid.: 90). It would therefore seem that the threat of
the lesbian vampire is destroyed with the murder of Frederique.
 But despite first appearances, the ending of Les Biches goes against
the grain. The film ends with continuation, not closure; the threat
of the lesbian vampire is not contained but in fact renewed, since
although the original (Frederique) is killed, she is in fact no longer
a lesbian (or a vampire). She has already been vampirised and
replaced by the copy (Why). Frederique is thus punished not as a
judgement on her lesbianism, but because she has 'gone straight'
and betrayed Why in order to fulfill her (heterosexual) love of Paul.
And, as the final image of the film suggests, far from enjoying the
vampire's 'violent destruction', Paul himselflooks set to become
her next victim.
    In the 'bisexual triangle' of the archetypal lesbian vampire film,
the vampire's female victim 'is usually a "nice, sweet girl" ... who is
merely a receptacle to assume the values' of the predatory lesbian
and/or the male suitor (ibid.: 92). In Les Biches, Why certainly
assumes this position. But Chabrol maps on to this archetype the
question of political (rather than just sexual and moral) values.
The film thus becomes a political vampire narrative about the
appropriation of Frerlerique's bourgeois values by the innocent
and impoverished 'receptacle' that is Why. The brilliance of Les
Biches lies in this portrayal of the embourgeoisement of the working
classes through the metaphor of a vampire breeding new vam-
pires. The vampirising in the film is thus doubled by class and
power as well as by sex. When Frerlerique first meets Why, the
sexual and economic power relations between them are expressed
spatially: Why kneels at Frederique's feet, drawing does on the
pavement. Leaning on the bridge, Frerlerique tosses a bank note
on to the ground: the vampire has bought her next victim. In this
brief opening sequence, Chabrol combines the mythical power of
the vampire with the economic power of money (and class: the
vampire is of course an 'aristocratic figure', her victim penniless
and possibly homeless). The twin themes of vampirism and
embourgeoisement are succinctly expressed in the motif of
replication which runs through Les Biches. In the prologue, after
48    ClAUDE CHABROl


 Frederique has picked up Why, they stop by the Seine to look at
some prints. When Frederique asks why two identical prints are
priced differently, she is informed that the expensive one is the
original and the cheap one is a copy. Crucially, Frederique is
however unable to tell them apart. The implications for the narra-
tive are clear: in terms of politics and vampirism, the expensive
original (Frederique) will be replaced by the cheap copy (Why),
without anyone (not even Paul?) being able to tell the difference.
    If the episode with the print-seller functions as a clue to the
development of the narrative, so too - in more explicitly political
terms - does the first scene set in St Tropez. It is characteristic of
Chabrol, particularly in the carefully crafted Helene cycle, to
include in his films miniature versions of the main narrative.
These are often texts which operate as clues to the meaning of the
film, and also as idealised models against which the behaviour of
the characters is implicitly compared. The compromised revenge
narrative of Que la bete meure, for example, is measured against
Homer's Iliad, an idealised account of heroism and vengeance. In
Le Boucher, Helene's desire for romance is expressed in the form
of the Balzac dictation that she gives her class, and against which
Popaul can only be found wanting. 8 The idealised text in Les Biches
is the revolutionary tract read aloud by Riais (Dominique Zardi) as
Why and Frederique approach the villa, and which concludes with
the lines: 'La revolution, c'est un soulevement, un acte de violence
par lequel une classe en renverse une autre'.9 It is against this
ideal that Why's actions will be measured. At first it seems that
Why is indeed planning to overthrow her bourgeois mistress:
several scenes show her resentment at being treated as a sexual
object-cum-servant. But as the mise en scene of the film makes
abundantly clear, when the moment comes, Why does not achieve
a true revolution. Far from overthrowing Frederique, she copies
her, wearing her clothes and speaking in her voice. In Chabrol's
words, 'Why replaces Frecierique, but she does it by becoming

 8 For more on these two examples. see the accounts of the two films, below, pp. 55
   and 62..
 9 'Revolution is an an upheaval, an act of violence by means of which one class
   overthrows another'

Frederique' (Yakir 1979:9).'° Revolution in Les Biches is thus simply
a reiteration of the status quo, a repetition, in which the proletariat
simply become the new ruling class. The point is driven home
when Riais discovers Why dressed as Frederique. To his assertion
that 'Je suis un revolutionnaire, moi, quand quelque chose me
deplait, je renverse!', Why replies, 'Mais je suis tres bien comme
s:a, moi'." Her own reaction to the subservient position she finds
herself in is not to revolt so much as to imitate (to become
Frederique). That Riais is in fact no revolutionary but merely a
hanger-on, an annoying and parasitic dilettante, only increases
the pessimism of Chabrol's political prognosis in the film. With
Why simply a cheap copy of the bourgeois original, Paul a
calculating social climber (trading up from Why to Frederique),
and Robegue and Riais (the intellectual revolutionaries)" nothing
more than leeches, there seems to be no way of challenging the
power of the bourgeoisie embodied by Frederique. Les Biches was
released in March 1968. Far from ignoring the political questions
of the time, Chabrol might in fact be said to have made a very
astute prediction about the outcome of the social unrest which
swept France a few weeks later. For the 'events' of May 1968,
although they brought about a great number of reforms, fell as far
short of genuine revolution as Why does in Les Biches.



La Femme injidele
The first film of the Helene cycle, strictly speaking, is La Femme
infidele (1968). Charles (Michel Bouquet) is the straight-laced but
decent husband and Heiene (Stephane Audran) the inscrutable,
unfaithful wife. Although there is no Paul, the role of charismatic
playboy devolves to Victor (Maurice Ronet). Essentially, the triangle

10   Italics in original.
11   'I'm a revolutionary: when I don't like something, I overthrow it!' - 'But I'm fine
     like this'
12   Despite several evasive statements by Chabrol. it seems clear that these two
     characters are intended to lampoon French intellectuals of the time, and in
     particular Alain Robbe·Grillet (,Robegue-Riais').
50    CLAUDE CHABROl


established in Les Cousins remains, but with a twist. The male
rivals are still analogous with Chabrol and Gegauff - Bouquet has
said that his portrayal of Charles was based on the director's own
personality - but this time Charles is the murderer not the victim.')
The second, and more shocking twist, is that the husband's
murder of his wife's lover actually resuscitates their dull marriage,
and ironically reunifies their family even as he himself is taken
away by the police. All the irony of this situation is captured in the
superb and justly famous final shot, which will be discussed
shortly. Written by Chabrol alone, La Femme infidele none the less
shows the influence of his three mentors, Paul Gegauff, Fritz
Lang and Alfred Hitchcock. The characterisation of Charles and
Victor, as we have noted, is Gegauffian. The plot also bears a resem-
blance, not just to the triangles of Les Cousins and Les Biches (both
co-written by GegaufI), but also to another Gegauff screenplay, for
Rene Clement's Plein Solei! (1959). Chabrol himself had originally
wanted to film the source novel, Patricia Highsmith's The Talented
Mr Ripley, but the rights were offered to Clement instead. The
result was a cool and detached thriller which featured a typical
Gegauffian anti-hero in Tom Ripley - deceitful, theatrical, but
vulnerable. (The character of Ripley in Plein Solei! is also the
spiritual father of Albin Mercier in Chabrol's L'Oei! du malin
(1961): both men are defensive, lower-class hangers-on who are
attracted by the wealth and leisure of their social 'betters'; they
share a talent for manipulation and deceit, but also a vulnerability
symbolised by their fear of water and inability to swim.) Like La
Femme infidele, Clement's Plein solei! features a sudden murder in
everyday circumstances. In Plein Solei! Tom kills Phillip in mid
conversation, during a casual game of poker; in La Femme infidele
Charles clubs Victor to death between whiskeys, also in the middle
of a banal, if awkward, conversation. In both films, the compla-
cent victim is played by Maurice Ronet. What distinguishes
Chabrol's murder scene from Clement's is the exaggerated, parodic


13 This may explain why the Gegauffian figure is not called Paul, since Chabrol has
   stated that a Charles cannot be seen to kill a Paul. For more on this. see the
   analysis of Que la bite rneure, below. p. 61.
                                                 THE HElENE CYClE          51


banality of the conversation which precedes the murder, during
which Charles asks Victor how many rooms there are in his
apartment, and Victor advises Charles to move from Versailles to
Neuilly. As in the excruciating pre-dinner conversation from Que
la bete meure, the polite but meaningless small-talk of bourgeois
etiquette is haunted by the threat of violence, the eruption of the
same brutal desires it is designed to hold in check (Charles's
murder of Victor, Paul's explosive entrance and angry outbursts).
    Echoes of Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) have often been pointed
out - and at times criticised - in the sequences of La Femme infidele
following Victor's murder, when Charles tries to dispose of the
body.'4 A less obvious but more revealing Hitchcockian intertext is
in fact Notorious (1946), a twisted love story which like La Femme
infidele centres on mutual guilt and mutual suspicion which
threaten the potential happiness of a romantic couple. Chabrol
wrote about the film in the book on Hitchcock he co-authored with
Rohmer, and his comments throw light on the theme of speaking
one's love in La Femme infidele: 'The misfortune of the prota-
gonists comes from the fact that as victims of their mutual
preconceptions, they refuse to pronounce the saving "word". They
fail to appreciate the virtue of this confession' (Rohmer and
Chabrol 1957: 84). At the start of La Femme infidele, the 'saving
word' cannot be pronounced; it is blocked by He]{~ne's infidelity
and Charles's suspicion. Thus, when he asks her if she loves him,
she avoids the question. By contrast, and ironically by means of
the murder of Helene's lover, the word can be pronounced at the
close of the film; hence the mutual declaration of love imme-
diately before Charles is arrested: 'Je t'aime' - 'Je t'aime' - 'Je
t'aime comme un fou'.ls This narrative ofredemption also recalls
the plot of Lang's Clash by Night (1952), in which a marriage is
saved when an unfaithful wife (May) witnesses the ferocity of her
dull but decent husband Jerry's love for her, expressed by means
of his violence towards her playboy lover (Earl). In Lang's film, the


14 Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques (1954) is also a probable influence
   here, as well as a precursor to Psycho in several respects.
IS "love you' - 'I love you' - 'I love you madly'
52    CLAUDE CHABROL


murder of the lover is only figurative: May tells Jerry 'You're
killing him!'; Earl becomes metaphorically dead for her soon
afterwards. Chabrol takes this plot and pushes it to its logical
extension, literalising the death of the lover. Characteristically for
this period (reflecting the embourgeoisement of his settings and
characters in the 1960s), he also replaces Lang's working-class,
neorealist setting (a fishing village) with a deceptively glossy
bourgeois setting (the family home in Versailles).
    Accusations that Chabrol had become an apologist for the
bourgeoisie inevitably dogged La Femme infidele as they had Les
Biches a year earlier. But although there is no exploration of class
tensions in the former (the working class are completely absent,
apart from very minor characters such as the housekeeper), the
film is far from a simple celebration of the bourgeois lifestyle.
Beneath the glossy image of Helene and Charles's comfortable
life in Versailles (including conspicuous consumption of food and
drink, large house and garden, car, even the relative novelty of
television) there lurks a feeling of unease. At times this is simply a
question of suspense, or at others of narrative irony, as in the
champagne toast to 'cette memorable journee',16 which Michel
imagines is a celebration of his school report, but is for both
Charles and Helene a comment on her affair. But the prevailing
sense of unease is also subtly and brilliantly evoked by Jean
Rabier's camerawork and Jacques Gaillard's editing. La Femme
infidele begins with a tracking shot, from left to right, revealing a
large house, with a family group gathered in the front garden:
Charles, his mother, Helene, and their son Michel, who runs up to
them with a bouquet of flowers. The bourgeois family is apparently
secure and idyllic. But as Charles says to his mother, 'Le moindre
changement dans mon mode de vie pourrait troubler cette
harmonie'.'7 In the credit sequence which follows, the seductive
image of the family is blurred and then distorted beyond recogni-
tion, in a prelude to the explosion of suspicion and guilt which will
shatter the illusion of harmony immediately after the credits

16 'to this memorable day·
17 'The slightest change in my lifestyle could unsettle this harmony'
                                                      THE HELENE CYCLE            53

 (when Charles guesses the meaning of Helene's secret phone-
call). And when the status quo is threatened, it must be reasserted
at any price. The camerawork, symbolism and the narrative
function (alongside Charles himself) to achieve this return to
harmony throughout the rest of the film. On the level of the
narrative, this means that Victor, the source of the disruption,
must be removed, so that Charles and Helene can speak their love
at the end. On the level of metaphor, it involves the symbolism of
the missing jigsaw puzzle (the lack within the family which must
be repaired) and the T.S. Eliot poem that Charles watches on
television the day he follows Helene to Victor's flat: 'Here the
impossible union / Of spheres of existence is actual, / Here the
past and the future / Are conquered, and reconciled'. On the level
of mise en scene, it means that the camera movements in the film
are all submitted to a similar logic of returning to the beginning.
Thus the left-to-right tracking shots in the first half of the film,
including the opening shot, are matched by tracking shots in the
other direction in the closing stages. As Chabrol explains, this
principle determined the shooting of the entire film: 'chaque
mouvement est suivi de son inverse, si bien que tout finit par
revenir ala meme place. Achaque fois qu'il y a un travelling avant,
il est suivi d'un travelling arriere ... ; de meme chaque panor-
amique gauche est suivi par un panoramique droite et ainsi de
suite'18 (Braucourt 1971: 92). Hence also the systematic use of shot
/ reverse-shot patterns in the dialogue scenes, and the breaking of
the 180 0 rule,'9 for instance when Charles and Helene embrace
after the visit to the night-club.
    Most unsettling are the tiny fissures in the editing, like cracks
in the image of the idyllic family group at the start of the film.
These miniature jump-cuts are most evident in the murder of
Victor (as his body falls) and the cleaning of the blood in the sink.
18 'each [cameral movement is followed by its opposite, so that everything comes
   back to the point of departure. Each time there is a tracking forwards, it's
   followed by a tracking back; in the same way each pan to the left is followed by a
   pan to the right, and so on'
19 This is the classical realist convention that a scene, if shot from one side of its
   central axis (the 180 degree line), will not suddenly be shot from the other side
   (which would disrupt the construction of filmic space).
54     CLAUDE CHABROL


The editing of the first sequence after the credits is also troubling:
 as Charles bursts in on Heli~ne's phone conversation with Victor,
 the editing switches quickly and disconcertingly between a mid
 shot, a medium close-up, then a mid shot again, while the camera
 tracks rapidly from Charles to Helene and back again. There are
other scenes which suggest a latent violence or an emptiness
beneath the glossy surface of the mise en scene: the long pause
before Helene appears in the doorway of Charles's office, or the
moments, as Charles reflects on his wife's affair, when the ambient
sound (traffic noises and so on) fades to be replaced by suspense-
ful music. These temporary disturbances are comparable to the
break in the television programme that Charles watches early in
the film. A message on the screen declares 'Veuillez nous excuser
de cette interruption momantanee de l'image'!O But in La Femme
infidele, 'normal service' is only fully resumed in the doomed
conclusion. There is a central irony here, as in Juste avant la nuit:
bourgeois harmony, which must be preserved at all costs, is
actually salvaged by murder. Thus the apparently calm and
'natural' status quo rests on behind-the-scenes violence (even if
this violence is not explicitly politicised here, as it is in Les Biches
and elsewhere). But there is an ambivalence in the film, as so
often in Chabrol's work, since La Femme infidele is also a dark
romance, in which love is rediscovered at the last moment. This
romantic element (the Notorious theme) is expressed by reference
to another film of Hitchcock's. As Chabrol explains, the final shot in
La Femme infidile uses a technique which Hitchcock had developed
for Vertigo - a simultaneous zoom forwards and tracking back-
wards - to show a final glimpse of Helene and Michel, and to
express the paradoxical situation in which Charles is emotionally
reunited with them even as he is physically taken away from them
by the police: 'C'est un plan qui se contredit lui-meme! Mais c'est
tres beau, car c'est de la que venait ou non le happy end. Si le
travelling arriere finissait avant le zoom avant, le film finissait
bien puisqu'on se rapprochait de la bonne femme. Mais si le
zoom avant finissait avant le travelling arriere, le film finissait mal

puisqu'on reculait''' (ibid.: 92). The result is the most famous
example of Chabrol's tendency to end his films with a moment of
unsettling ambivalence rather than the expected narrative closure:
'people seem to think that the final shot explains everything when
the contrary is true. It is a question mark' (Overbey I97T 81).



Que la bete meure

Chabrol is a master of the pre·credit sequence, from the decept-
ively happy family group in La Femme infidele to the triple suicide
in Dr M. The twenty-shot sequence that begins Que la bete meure
(1969) is a case in point: expressive, economical, terrible. The
camera focuses on a young boy (Michel), then zooms back to show
the beach where he is playing. Cut to a harbour scene with a road
in the background. As a black car comes into view, a melancholy
song by Brahms is heard. The car is driving very fast, from right to
left. Michel begins walking in the opposite direction (the two
opposing tracking shots suggest that these two movements will
inevitably collide). The camera follows the car again, from right to
left (a reversal of the direction of reading, of progression, hence
implying death)." A shot of the radio as the driver changes gear
shows that the song is coming from the car radio (rather implaus-
ibly, given what we will learn about the character of the driver,
Paul). A shot of the road from above the speeding car shows a
huge and ominous black bonnet; the top of the screen cuts off the


2[   'It's a shot which contradicts itself! It's a tracking backwards with a zoom
     forwards! But it's very beautiful, since it's this shot which gives the film a happy
     ending - or not. If the tracking backwards finished before the zoom forwards,
     the film finished happily because you were getting nearer to the wife, But if the
     zoom forwards finished before the tracking back. the film finished unhappily
     because you were moving away.' Chabral adds that in all three takes of this
     ending, the zoom finished first, so the film ends unhappily. I would suggest that
     the main effect, however, remains one of ambivalence, This is heightened by
     the question of point of view: is the camera here subjective (Charles'S point of
     view) or objective'

 road in the distance and the vanishing point, thus creating a sense
 of blindness, of ignorance in the face of fate, and also giving the
 impression that Paul will not see what is coming up. Michelleaves
 the beach and walks silently into the village. A shot of the
 passenger (Helene) from the back seat; Paul puts his arm round
 her as the car enters the village. The sound of bells as the camera
pans slowly along the village street from the church tower to
 Michel, walking in the middle of the road. The music is heard
again, loudly, as in quick succession, the church comes into view
and Helene lurches across the car, grabbing the dashboard;
 Michel's face looms up; the car hits him; he falls to the ground
 (seen from above); Paul tells Helene to shut up as she turns round
and begins to scream. Finally, Helene's point of view as she looks
back at the scene of the accident. The sequence ends with a shot of
Michel's body lying in the middle of the road as the car disappears.
The shot is held, in silence. As well as the brutal fact of the
accident itself (which provides the impetus for all that follows),
several other things are concisely expressed here, most notably the
mystery of the driver's identity (we see Helene's face but only half
of Paul's), the consequences of the crash for the two people in the
car (the impact is experienced from Helene's perspective rather
than from Paul's; subsequently she will have a breakdown while
he will deny that anything even took place); the sense of impla·
cable fate and impending death (the song, the black car, the two
movements that collide, the truncated shot of the road ahead, the
glimpse of the church, the sound of bells). The premise of the
revenge narrative, the idea of destiny and the almost inevitable
process ofloss - the essential themes and emotions of the film -
have been expressed in less than three minutes.
    The most perfect film of the accomplished Helene cycle, Que la
bite meure is a piece of fearful symmetry, in which terrible emotions
and brutal actions are framed in a classical pattern. The emotional
stakes are high, since the narrative concerns the killing of a child
and the avenging of his death. The passions involved are con-
trolled and accentuated by the poise of the mise en scene and the
cyclical pattern of the plot. As Charles says at the close of the film,
'C'est digne d'une tragedie grecque. Un homme tue un enfant;
                                                     THE HELENE CYCLE           57

l'enfant de cet homme le tuera a son tour'.·3 Que la bite meure is in
fact a Greek tragedy and a revenge narrative at once. On the one
hand, the claustrophobic symmetry of the plot echoes classical
drama, while the poeticising of death and revenge in Charles's
diary is parodied by references to Homer's Iliad.· 4 On the other
hand, the emotions evoked, and the character of the righteous but
ultimately indecisive and troubled avenger, recall Fritz Lang's The
Big Heat (1953) and Rancho Notorious (1951), both of which tell 'the
old story of hate, murder and revenge'.·5 But Lang and Chabrol
qualify the act of revenge, so that he who confronts a beast risks
becoming a beast himself As a result, both Que la bete meure and
Rancho Notorious subvert the cathartic act of vengeance on which
the revenge narrative is predicated - and which takes place, for
instance, in revenge westerns such as Mann's Winchester '73 (1950).
Vern in Rancho Notorious and Charles in Que la hete meure spurn
opportunities to kill the men they have remorselessly hunted down.
In the former case, Kinch is actually killed by Vern's friend
Frenchy. In the latter, Charles mayor may not kill Paul (both
interpretations are possible), but the murder takes place off-
screen and is therefore invisible, repressed (as were bloody events
in classical tragedy). The similarities with The Big Heat are even
clearer: like Charles in Que la hete meure, Bannion is caught in a
circle of tragedy and repetition: destined to repeat the violence of
his adversary, he is only redeemed thanks to the sacrifice of
another (Debbie in The Big Heat, Philippe in Que la bete meure). In
both films, the death of the hero's wife is compounded by the
death (or loss) of her substitute (Debbie, HeU~ne). This is com-

23 'It's worthy of a Greek tragedy. A man kills a child; the child of that man kills
    him in turn.' Charles is referring here to Philippe's apparent confession to
    patricide. See below, p. 61, for the alternative explanation of Paul's murder.
24 James Monaco interprets these Greek allusions, and especially 'the image in
    The Wad of a spear through the back of the head', as indicative of the 'paternal
    and platonic love' between Charles and Philippe. See Monaco: 1976, 2.73.
2.5 Quotation taken from the theme song of Rancho Notorious. There are also
    several echoes of Rancho Notorious in Les Biches, notably the sequences at
    Frederique's villa in St Tropez, where she holds court much as Altar (Marlene
    Dietrich) does at the Chuck·a·Luck ranch. Riais rides Robegue at the soiree like

pounded for Charles by the loss of his substitute son, Philippe.
Chabrol makes several direct allusions to The Big Heat, notably the
scene in the empty house, the enquiries at the garages, and
Charles's cross-examination of Helene about Paul (comparable to
Bannion asking Debbie about Vince).
    Que la bete meure pits an honourable and grieving Charles
(Michel Duchaussoy) against the boorish and bullying Paul (Jean
Yanne) responsible for his son's death. The apparent simplicity of
the plot and the characterisation is gradually complicated, how-
ever. Charles is not above using HeIene (Caroline Cellier) as a
means to enter Paul's family circle. Once there, he twice finds
himself unable to kill Paul (either from cowardice or cunning,
according to one's interpretation of the plot). Moreover, when
Paul is at last horribly murdered, his son Philippe is either respon-
sible for an action that Charles, for all his talk of vengeance,
cannot actually commit or, just as damningly, is allowed to spend
a night in the cells before Charles admits to the murder himself
(again, both possibilities remain open). Ultimately, the film evokes
a pervasive sense of loss, in which not just Michel but also Paul
(for all his abrasiveness, a not entirely unsympathetic character),
Helene, Philippe and Charles himself are all destroyed by what
has happened. Charles's final letter to Helene emphasises the past
conditional, the elegiac tense of the entire film: 'Si nous n'avions
pas ete emportes par tout cela, je t'aurais aime .. :26 The symmetry
of both narrative and mise en scene makes this tragedy all the more
apparent. Charles finds a surrogate wife in Helene and a surrogate
son in Philippe, only to lose both of them again. (The physical
similarity between the two boys is striking. Michel is in fact played
by Stephane di Napoli and Philippe by his older brother, Marc.)
Reminders of his dead son are everywhere, from the teddy-bear he
cannot throwaway to the spectral silhouette of Philippe which
haunts the scene in Paul's garage. The narrative is in several ways
repetitious, with the (off-screen) murder of Paul as the central
point. On either side of this invisible apex, Charles loses both a

   other examples of the past conditional in this short letter.

son and a wife; he watches a film about death (the home movie
and the television report); he is involved in an attempt to solve a
crime, in which a daring hypothesis proves to be true (Charles's
suggestion to the police that the killer is a garage owner; the
detective's suggestion to Charles that the diary is a deliberate alibi).
To the love scene with Helene early in the film corresponds the
absence oflove scene in the hotel at the end; the parallel with the
former increases the sense of absence and loss in the latter. Pierre
Jansen's superb, romantic music - often the soundtrack to Charles's
diary entries - evokes the continuing trauma of Michel's death,
since it presents a number of variations on the song from Brahms
which plays during the fatal accident. There are also persistent
splashes of red throughout the film, each of which recalls Michel's
blood on the road at the end of the credit sequence: the pen with
which Charles writes his vengeful diary, the tones of the Breton
landscape, the lighting of the nightclub where he meets Helene,
the decor of Paul's living-room, the colour of Charles's sowester,
and so on. Finally there is the camerawork, and in particular the
use of the zoom.
    Barely used before Chabrol's period of technical experimen-
tation in the mid 1960s spy films, zooms are central to his film
style in the Helene cycle (see the final shot of La Femme infidele, or
the slow zoom in on the back of Helene's head in Le Boucher). In
Que la bite meure, the claustrophobic repetitions of narrative,
music and mise en scene are mirrored by the patteming of the
zooms, which tend to come in pairs, the second of which reverses
the direction of the first. In other words, a zoom-in will be
followed by a zoom-out, and vice versa. This is evident throughout
the film, often as a means of framing a given action (when Paul
slips on the clifftop, a zoom-in on Charles's face is followed by a
zoom-out from the rocks below) or an entire sequence (the
episode in Paul's garage is introduced by a zoom-out from a tree
in blossom, and concludes with a zoom-in on the same tree). The
tragic circle is completed in the sublime closing sequence, a
recreation of the ending of Lang's Moonfleet (1955), in which a
dying man leaves behind his surrogate son and sails alone into the
dawn. Chabrol's film has come full circle in three ways. First,
60    ClAUDE CHABROL


there is the return - after so many variations in the film score - of
the Brahms song, the song of death. Second, the camerawork - a
zoom-out from Charles as he sails away - repeats the opening
shot, a zoom-out from Michel playing on the beach. And third, for
the final shot, the camera actually sweeps in a huge circle over the
sea before coming to rest on the crashing waves, thus encapsula-
ting the movement of the film, and symbolising three deaths: that
ofMichel's mother (more or less absent from the film but present
in the homonym la mer/mere),'7 that of Michel (who died walking
home from the sea) and the potential death of Charles himself (as
implied by the Moonjleet intertext and the quotation from Brahms:
'11 faut que la bete meure, mais l'homme aussi').,8
    This is not to say, however, that Que la bere meure is purely
repetitious. There is a fundamental development within the film
which concerns the question of perspective and identification.
The pre-credit sequence, analysed above, is scrupulously objective,
in that it avoids presenting the accident from any character's point
of view (there is only one shot out of the twenty which is possibly
identifiable as subjective: the glance back at the crossroads which
may belong to Helene; above all, Chabrol carefully avoids giving
any shots from Michel's point of view). This objective style of
filming, typical of Lang and of Chabrol at his most Langian, is
however suspended after the credit sequence. From this point
until the murder of Paul. Chabrol encourages the spectator to
identify with Charles's perspective. This is facilitated by the emo-
tive nature of Charles's position, and by the conventional use of
point-of.view shots whereby we see what Charles sees. But Chabrol
goes further than this in building up a subjective narration which
-like Albin's story in L'(Ei! du malin - includes the use of music,
commentary and camerawork. Hence the instances when Charles's
diary entries are not only given in voice-over, but are also accom-
panied by Jansen's tragic score (based on Brahms) and by long,
slow pans (usually from right to left, towards death) across the
Breton countryside (itselfbleak and red tinged, a pathetic fallacy to
reflect Charles's state of mind). Immediately after the opening

credits, the movement from objectivity to subjectivity is apparent:
as Charles begins to write his revenge diary, we hear sombre music,
and then the first entry, 'Je vais tuer un homme','9 in voice-over.
Charles's face is shot in close-up against a background of trees
(moving right to left); although this is simply explained by his
present situation (sat in a moving taxi), it also heralds the dramatic
panoramas that will punctuate his search for the killer. There
follows a shot of the taxi driver from Charles's point of view, and
then in a simple but expressive movement, the camera shifts from
Charles's face to the trees outside, suggesting that this landscape
is to a degree subjective (the pathetic fallacy again).
    Unexpectedly and crucially, although Chabrol films much of
the hunt for Paul in this manner, he does not represent Paul's
murder subjectively - in fact, it is not represented directly at all,
while the police enquiry which follows is filmed objectively. Only
in the coda - in which Charles repays Philippe's sacrifice and con-
fession with his own - does the subjective narration (music, voice-
over, slow pans) return. But the identification with Charles already
established in the first half of the film enables Chabrol to pull off
the major twist in the tale - Philippe's confession, and hence the
possibility of two conflicting interpretations of the murder (revenge
or patricide). Objectively speaking, Charles is the murderer: hence
his boast to Paul that 'C'est comme si tu etais mort',lO his hearty
appetite when Paul has thrown him out and thus apparently
thwarted him, and the uneasiness of Philippe's confession, during
which he stares at Charles and refuses to look at the detective. But
Charles's temporary connivance in Philippe's account, and the
identification with Charles established by the subjective narration,
encourages the spectator to make an erroneous (if plausible)
interpretation and to accept Philippe's false confession in order to
free Charles from guilt and imprisonment. Any confusion raised
by Chabrol's remark that 'you'll never see a Charles kill a Paul'
(Nogueira and Zalaffi 1971: 6) should be dispelled by two facts:
first, the murder takes place off-screen, and second, Charles acts
under his pen name, Marc Andrieu. In a quite brutal objective
29 'I'm going to kill a man'
30 'It's as if you were already dead'
62   CLAUDE CHABROL


sequence, Charles and Helene's meal in the restaurant, the
invisible murder is in fact symbolically expressed by the cutting
up of a succulent roast duck. (We learn later that Paul was dying
horribly from poisoning at this precise moment.) As Chabrol has
written of Hitchcock, the subjective point of view is replaced by
objectivity at the crucial moment in the plot (Chabrol I976: I33-
4). But by restoring Charles's perspective at the end of the film,
Chabrol allows Que la bete meure to end with a renewed (if quali·
fied) identification between spectator and avenger, and with a
renewed (if qualified) depth of emotion. The righteous catharsis
of the traditional revenge narrative is absent, but there is a sense
of loss (instead of hatred) and of sacrifice (instead of triumph).
The means may be the same, but Charles's subjective narration
now expresses a much more poignant experience than the story
he set out to tell, 'the old story of hate, murder and revenge'.



Le Boucher
Written quickly by Chabrol, simply constructed with only two main
characters, Le Boucher was the most popular film of the Helene
cycle, and remains his most famous work to date. (The Parisian
box-office figures for Le Boucher (I969) show 2I9,000 spectators,
as opposed to 204,000 for La Rupture, 203,000 for Que la bite meure,
and less than 200,000 for the other films of the cycle (Braucourt
I97I:I77). Le Boucher also did very well abroad, especially in the
United States.) The film concerns the uneasy balance between two
conflicting principles embodied by the two protagonists. On the
one hand there is culture, education, civilisation, represented in
the person of the schoolteacher, Mademoiselle Helene (Stephane
Audran); and on the other nature, violence, sex and death, the
hidden forces beneath the surface of society, personified by the
butcher, Popaul (Jean Yanne). Although apparently schematic, this
dichotomy fluctuates and surprises throughout the film. Not only
are Helene and Popaul in some ways as alike as they are opposite,
but the film maintains the tentative possibility of romance and
marriage between them - according to which one might see the
                                            THE HELENE CYCLE        63

schoolboy Charles as the potential couple's surrogate son - even
after Popaul's murders come to light. The plot centres on Helene's
discovery (and ours) that Popaul is the serial killer operating in the
village. The discovery is first made, then refuted, then confirmed
again, by means of the lighter given to Popaul by Helene. As Chabrol
explains, the lighter is 'the only dramatic element' in the film, the
marker of Popaul's guilt and the catalyst for the simple narrative
pattern: '(I) The lighter is offered. (2) The lighter is found on the
cliff-top [i.e. the crime scene]. So, the conclusion: it's the said
lighter. (3) No, it's not the one. (4) Yes it is. So, it's very easy. I
adore symmetry' (Yakir 1979: 4).
    Like Le Beau Serge (1958), Le Boucher is set in a remote and
enclosed French village (Sardent in the one, Tremolat in the other).
The first quarter of an hour or so of Le Boucher is a naturalistic
record of a village wedding, at which Helene and Popaul are
merely two guests among many. What emerges from this long
first sequence is the centrality of marriage to the continuity of
village life, and the suggestion (when they dance together, and
when he serves her the roast) that the butcher and the school-
teacher may follow suit. But almost immediately there are hints
that things will not be that simple. Where the wedding sequence,
and the theme of hope, continuity and community that it evokes,
is introduced by the ringing of church bells, the second strand in
the narrative - the thriller element, the theme of the traumatic
past, of war and murder - is introduced by a glimpse of the war
memorial and by the opening bars of Pierre Jansen's atonal score.
After Helene and Popaul stroll together through the village and
then part, the camera remains fixed on the war memorial as the
discordant music begins. Although the music lightens in tone and
rises in pitch - in parallel with Helene's ascent to her flat above
the schoolroom - the sense of unease remains. Jansen's unsettling
music returns throughout the film to underline the suspenseful
or mysterious moments of the narrative - the arrival of the police,
the discovery of the murder victims, and so on. Once it seems
clear that he is the killer, Popaul is associated with the war
memorial and the menacing music, in particular during the two
nocturnal sequences when he approaches Helene's flat. (The
64     CLAUDE CHABROL


 symmetry underlying the film is upheld here. but with a typical
 twist: in the first of these sequences. Popaul is seemingly proven
 innocent; in the second. he confesses he is guilty.) The church
bells. meanwhile. are also heard repeatedly. signalling the rites of
life and death (the wedding and the funeral) and structuring the
everyday cycle of village existence (the time of day. the end of
classes on the hour). A contrast is established between Helene
 (order and continuity. the school. the church. the future of the
village in the form of the children) and Popaul (the repressed
violence on which Helene's apparently tranquil order is based. the
traumas and wars of the past. which spill over in the form of his
reminiscences about the army and atrocities in Indochina. and
ultimately in the form of the murders).
    But in Le Boucher as in Que la bite meure the ostensibly simple.
essentialist characterisation of the two leads is gradually broken
down. Like the 'beast' played by Jean Yanne the previous year.
Popaul may be a brute and a killer. but he is also a generous man
who loves life (and Chabrol's favourite symbol of life. food).
Helene. although intelligent. graceful and cultured. is also pre-
sented at times as a cold. diffident figure. who has physically
retreated from life. first by leaving Paris for Tremolat. second by
locking herself in a tower high above the rest of the village. And to
a degree. the two protagonists are comparable. Both have traumas
in the past: Popaul his army experiences. Helene a love affair ten
years previously which ended in a breakdown. Neither can express
their affection for the other in direct terms: Popaul does so by
giving Heli~ne the leg oflamb and the cherries. Helene by giving
Popaul the lighter at the same time as refusing his kiss. This
action is paradoxical. and as such represents Helene's ambi-
valence towards Popaul, since the sexual connotations of the
lighter - it lights his fire. and makes her 'une allumeuse' J1 -
contradict the refusal of the kiss. (One might also compare the
size of the two lighters given as gifts in Le Boucher and La Femme
infidele: the flame of Helene's passion in the former is modest. in
the latter it is exaggeratedly large.) Most crucially. and in contrast
31 'a tease'. The French word 'allumer' means to light up (a cigarette), but also to
   turn on (sexually).
                                                    THE HELENE CYCLE           65

with La Femme infidele and Notorious, Helene cannot kiss Popaul
 (in effect speaking the 'saving word' oflove) until it is too late. In
fact, she is only able to do so when she knows that Popaul is dying.
It has been suggested in this context that Helene's sexual frigidity
recalls that of Hitchcock's Marnie (Braucourt 1971: 93). Certainly
there are allusions to Marnie (1964) in Le Boucher, notably
 Helene's need to bury the past by taking a new job (compare
Marnie's interview at Rutland's, where she speaks of needing
'good, hard, demanding work'), her black-out at a critical moment
(compare Marnie's reaction to the colour red), and her conjuring
up of Popaul at the schoolroom window (compare Marnie's dream
about the sailors tapping at the window because 'they want in').
But Hitchcock follows the development ofa stereotypical, if warped,
romance (red-blooded husband and frigid wife) to an implied
point of resolution and consummationY Chabrol, on the other
hand, charts the tragic impossibility of such a romance. And as he
himself has pointed out, sexual obsession is limited to the
characters in his films, whereas it is in fact shared by Hitchcock
(Jousse and Toubiana 199T 27-8). Where Chabrol keeps Popaul's
sexually motivated murders off-screen, Hitchcock cannot repress
Mark's implied sexual assault on Mamie: the subsequent scene,
in which Mark rescues Mamie from a suicide attempt by drown-
ing, is shot exactly like a rape.
    Although she is the object of Popaul's sexual obsession,
Helene in turn attempts to reconfigure what she knows of him to
fit her own romantic desires. This is the motive behind her denial
of his guilt, and her shattering relief when she is able to believe
him innocent (the scene with the cherries and the lighter). The key
to Helene's romantic fantasies is provided in the early dictation
sequence, during which she reads her class the following passage
from Balzac while Popaul appears, as if summoned by the text, at
the schoolroom window:
   En entendant ouvrir la porte de la chambre avec brusquerie,
   Helene s'etait levee du divan sur lequel elle reposait, mais elle vit le
32 Originally, the film was to have ended - rather like La Femme infidele - with a
   love scene 'to be interrupted by the arrival of the police who came to arrest
   Mamie' (Truffaut 1984: 470).

     les yeux d'un pere pour la reconnaitre. Le soleil des tropiques avait
     embelli sa blanche figure d'un teint de brune, d'un coloris

     respirait un air de grandeur, une fermete majestueuse, un senti-
     ment profond, par lequel i'ame la plus grossiere devait etre
     impressionee,JJ
The identification between the schoolmistress and Balzac's heroine
is immediately apparent, and is underlined twice: first when the
children laugh on hearing the heroine's name, and again when
Chabrol cuts from Popaul back to Helene at the mention of the
heroine's 'coloris merveilleux')4 Popaul is first seen at the window
when the text mentions 'les yeux d'un pere',35 This seems to hint at
voyeurism, particularly since Popaul is looking in at the children.
But the last line of the dictation, after which Popaul is
immediately ushered into the room by Helene, associates him
unequivocally with 'l'ame la plus grossiere',36 This impression is
confirmed when he proceeds to give Helene a leg oflamb (rather
than the expected romantic gift of flowers). None the less, in the
rehearsal for the village fete, Helene tries to recast Popaul as the
archetypal romantic hero, the marquis. Popaul, like the school
children but unlike Helene, is dressed in period costume inclu-
ding hose and frilly cuffs. His costume presents an outward show
of aristocratic refinement: ostensibly, he has become the marquis.
But as it progresses, the dance sequence reveals a gulf between the
two protagonists' fantasies of each other. Chabrol evokes Popaul's
desire in a long, slow, subjective zoom on Helene as the butcher
watches her in silence. When she turns and, addressing the

camera, asks Popaul to join the dance, the brooding tension eases
and there is a glimpse of romantic possibilities. These are swiftly
 shattered by what follows. Popaul's costume seems increasingly
incongruous as he stumbles clumsily next to Helene. The baroque
music only heightens the absurdity and stresses how far he falls
short of the figure of romantic hero. In fact, Popaul is charac-
terised as a schoolboy rather than a potential lover (a parallel
underlined here by the period costume and elsewhere by his habit
of calling her 'Mademoiselle Helene'). Helene appears unable to
swap sexual threat (butcher) for romantic ideal (marquis). Instead,
she is here confronted with a seemingly desexualised and inept
schoolboy (Popaul in costume), while elsewhere she will be
confronted with the tragic, dying man of the closing scenes (too
late), and the atavistic Cro-Magnon man (too threatening). Implicit
from the opening credits onwards, this last parallel is emphasised
in the central section. After the rehearsal, during which Popaul
tells Helene 'j'adore me deguiser',J7 she informs her class, on a
trip to the prehistoric caves, that if Cro-Magnon man were alive
today, 'Peut-Hre qu'il se transformerait pour vivre parmi nous,
peut-etre qu'il mourrait'.J8 There follows the grim proof that Popaul
has yet to achieve this transformation: the discovery of the second
murder victim on the cliff-top. As Helene unwittingly suggests, it
is Popaul's inability to transform himself (to submit his desires to
civilised codes of behaviour) that will also result in his own death.
    Ironically (and in keeping with the twisted symmetry of the
film), it is in the schoolroom - the very place where she invoked
the image of the romantic hero - that Helene is finally confronted
with Popaul-as-murderer. But the threat he poses is deflected in
the suicide that follows. Crucially, Chabrol films Popaul from
Helene's point of view here: when she shuts her eyes in response
to his approach with the knife, the screen fades to black. Con-
sequently, as in Que la bete meure, the critical action is not actually
shown, leaving room for different interpretations. Most logically,
Popaul has stabbed himself while the screen was black. But there

37 'I love dressing up'
38 'Perhaps he would transfonn himself in order to live among us; perhaps he
   would die'
68     CLAUDE CHABROl


remains the suggestion that HelE~ne is, if not literally responsible,
then at least morally responsible for his death. Not only does she
shut her eyes to his desperate confession, one may infer that she
fantasises his suicide, thus ultimately transforming him from
threatening brute to subjugated romantic hero, and allowing her
to accede to his dying demand for a kiss. Helene also shuts her
eyes in the hospital when the pulse of the red light ceases -
instants before she is told Popaul is dead. As Michael Walker has
noted, 'The whole section of the fIlm between the two moments
when she closes her eyes has an extra dimension - as if it were
also, in some sense, her fantasy ...: an idealisation of "what might
have been'" (Walker 1975: 51). As in Que la bete meure - which also
ends with an evocation of what might have been - the symmetry
of the narrative heightens the poignancy of the impossible
romance. When Helene kisses Popaul in the hospital, the spectre
of that refused kiss in the woods returns, as does Popaul's hopeful
comment Taime bien vous regarder comme tya, avec les enfants')9
Just like Charles and Helene in Que la bite meure, Popaul and
Helene could have loved each other (could even have had child-
ren) if they had not been carried away by more violent passions.
    Chabrol defines accepted morality as 'Une regIe du jeu qui
arrange une classe dominante', and as a means of hiding the fact
that '11 n'est point d'ames toutes noires, ni toutes blanches'4                     0


(Chabrol 1976: 53). In this context, Helene is the good soul, the
representative of dominant ideology and morality, while Popaul is
the evil soul, a scapegoat for society's ills. He is the embodiment
(via the psychological trauma of his war experiences, compulsively
repeated in his words and his actions) of the violence which
civilisation is built on but which it keeps repressed. As such, one
could say that Popaul - the proletarian war veteran - is destroyed
by Helene as the official representative of the dominant class, the
bourgeoisie. Le Boucher also bears comparison with both La
Femme infidele and Juste avant la nuit - fIlms in which the status

40 'The rules of a game which suits the dominant class'; 'No soul is completely evil,
   nor completely good'. Chabrol adds that the concept of moral relativism is the
   single theme common to all his films.

quo is preserved by the absorption or repression of violence
(the suicide of Popaul, the murder of Victor, the half-murder, half-
suicide of Charles). But there is a difference here: the cost to Helene.
At the end of La Femme infidele and Juste avant la nuit, Helene is
the focal point for the continuation of family life. In the former
she is framed holding Michel, in the latter she is the centre of a
family group (son, daughter, mother-in-law), with her dead
husband already forgotten. But at the end of Le Boucher, Helene is
alone, faced with an uncertain future. Even if the village is now a
purified community, from which the disruptive element, Popaul
(like Victor in La Femme infidele or Laura and Charles in Juste avant
la nuit) has been expelled, there remains the question of Helene's
future place in it. Formally, Chabrol ends the film on another note
of symmetry: 'Capri, petite ile', the song from the wedding
sequence, is heard over the final credits. But although the contin-
uity of the village and its rituals is thus reiterated, Helene herself
is more removed from the life of the community than ever before.
And where the film began with a series of establishing shots of
Tremolat, each closer than the last, it ends with the reverse: a series
of increasingly distant shots of the village in the morning mist, as
if to evoke the distance that now separates Helene (and Popaul)
from the society where they first seemed to belong.



La Rupture
La Rupture (1970) crystallises the melodramatic tendencies of the
Helene cycle, and the inter-class tensions implicit in Les Biches
and Le Boucher. On both counts, the film is unusually unequi-
vocal. Chabrol's characteristic ambivalence is almost entirely
absent, except - as ever - in the final shot. La Rupture pits absolute
good against absolute evil, in the form of a custody battle between
a working-class mother and her rich, megalomaniac father-in-law.
The mise en scene, especially the expressionist use of colour,
underlines this simple characterisation: warm, earthy, proletarian
reds for Helene (Stephane Audran), cold blue and sinister black
for Regnier (Michel Bouquet). It is above all the generic code of
70    ClAUDE CHABROl


the melodrama which allows the expression of such extremes in
La Rupture: 'The good people stay good. The villain stays bad.... I
wanted to make a melodrama, a real melodrama' (Noguiera and
Zalaffi 1971: 5).
     Melodrama and class are intimately related. But there are
conflicting theories about the social origins of the genre. It has
been linked with the proletarian entertainments of early cinema:
'Spectacle plebeien a l'origine, le cinema s'etait empare des
themes du feuilleton populaire et du melodrame Oll se retrouvent
... hasards providentiels, magie du double (sosies, jumeaux), aven-
tures extraordinaires, conflits oedipiens avec paratre, maratre,
orphelins, secret de la naissance, innocence persecutee'41 (Morin
1972: 22-3). According to others, however, 'the family whose
drama the melodrama enacts is ... the bourgeois family', therefore
'The characters are neither the rulers nor the ruled, but occupy a
middle ground, exercising local power, or suffering local power-
lessness, within the family or the small town' (Nowell-Smith 1977:
70-1). The magical and menacing universe that Morin describes
certainly seems nearer the world of La Rupture than the (American)
small town environment identified by Nowell·Smith. Hence the
presence in Chabrol's film of doubles (Sonia as 'l'autre Helene'),4'
of Charles's Oedipal struggle with his cruel parents, of Helene as
the embodiment of persecuted innocence, and of a general air of
magic and mystery, incarnated not only by the three old women
(the three fates) but also by the balloon-seller and by the ghostly
hand of destiny that is glimpsed in the tram-ride sequence. 4J
Moreover, La Rupture concerns precisely those social categories
absent in the bourgeois melodrama, 'the rulers' (Regnier) and 'the
ruled' (Helene). The only truly petit bourgeois characters are the

Pinellis, who run the guesthouse.+4 But the assertion that 'patri-
archal right is of central importance' (ibid.: 71) in the bourgeois
melodrama is pertinent here. In fact, throughout La Rupture we
observe patriarchal right in a literal battle with the matriarchal
concerns of what has been called the maternal melodrama. In
other words, the custody battle within La Rupture literalises a
number of melodramatic motifs, both bourgeois and proletarian:
not only good versus evil, but also mother versus father and more
generally, the matriarchal (emotional warmth, the true family, the
domestic sphere) versus the patriarchal (Regnier as the arch
patriarch, Michel as his future heir and thus a potential continu-
ation of his power). The central theme of the film, which holds all
these strands together, is possession, in both a material sense (the
custody battle, the Regnier inheritance) and also in a more occult
sense (drugs, destiny, doubles).
    For all the strident emotionalism, simple characterisation and
melodramatic themes, La Rupture is as precisely structured as the
rest of the Helene cycle. It is by means of attention to narrative
form and to mise en scene that Chabrol brings out the full impact of
the melodrama. As in early melodrama, doubling is a key theme.
Here it is present at the level of the narrative (the opening and
penultimate sequences both concern a domestic breakfast which
ends in an attack on Helene, first by Charles, then by Paul) and
above all in the characterisation. Sonia is not just disguised as
Helene late in the film, but acts as her 'evil twin' throughout. It is
Sonia (who looks like Helene even before wearing the wig) who
enacts the illicit behaviour that Helene is falsely accused of:
dishonesty, slovenliness, sexual obsession, and ultimately the
corruption of Elise with pornography and drugs. In a sense, Sonia
is the sexualised (and hence demonised) side of Helene, who
herself, as Paul admits, is as white as the driven snow. 45 (There is
also a doubling of characters from Chabrol's earlier films: when

44 The guesthouse is reminiscent of the pension Vauquerin Balzac's Le Pere Coriot,
   and certain echoes of Balzac's melodramatic novel can be found in La Rupture.
45 Thus Helene is the 'white woman' (desexualised mother) while Sonia is the 'red
   woman' (sexualised, threatening). For more on this traditional dichotomy in the
   representation of women, see Theweleit 1987.
72   CLAUDE CHABROL


Charles throws his mother down the stairs, he is revealed as an
adult version of the son in La Muette; Monsieur Pinelli, an alcoholic
since the birth of his mentally handicapped child, is an older
version of Serge in Le Beau Serge.) As in most of his fIlms, Chabrol
uses mise en scene extremely effectively to externalise the charac-
terisation. This is not just typical of Chabrol but also of melo-
drama, which relies on the 'externalisation of internal emotions
and their embodiment within the mise en scene or decor' (Doane
1987: 72). In La Rupture, the emotions associated with the two lead
characters are embodied by expressionist colour, as suggested
above. For Regnier this means black and blue, signifying evil and
coldness. His first appearance is notable in this respect: he enters
the (largely white) children's ward wearing a black coat and tall
black hat, thus resembling the archetypal villain of Victorian
melodrama. (If Sonia is Helene's evil twin, the thespian Gerard
Mostelle, dressed also in black and given to melodramatic delivery
and gestures, is Regnier's good twin.) For Helene, it means warm,
earthy reds and browns. Her son Michel is also associated with
red, as is Charles during his convalescence, when he is clearly
infantilised, and is mothered by Helene (another example of the
doubling of characters within the fIlm).
   The all-pervasive influence that Regnier exercises through his
wealth is externalised in the shades of blue which seem to
surround Helene, particularly at crucial moments in the narrative.
(Compare the use of blue to signify Why's descent into madness
in Les Biches and to symbolise Philippe's oppressive and violent
personality in Une partie de plaisir.) On her arrival at the pension,
for instance, she is confronted by the cold and suspicious Madame
Pinelli (a weak and petty character who will be influenced by
Regnier's financial offer later in the fIlm). While Helene is framed
on the right of the screen, dressed in reddish brown, with a similar-
coloured background behind her, Madame Pinelli is framed on
the left, dressed completely in blue, against a blue wall. Blue
begins to surround Helene from this point onwards: hence the
overpowering decor of her room, the nocturnal scene where Paul
makes his last desperate attempt to kidnap her, and the shot of
Helene standing alone outside Regnier's house, framed against a
                                                      THE HELENE CYCLE             73

dark-blue door. During the acid trip which threatens her sanity at
the close of the film, Helene maintains an awareness of the real
threat to her son by repeating to herself the importance of the
colour blue. This insistence on colour in La Rupture expresses the
apparently simple conflicts of melodrama and of class war: red
versus blue, good versus evil, passion versus cunning, working
class versus upper class, and so on. It also underlines the meaning
of the quotation from Racine at the start of the film: 'Mais queUe
epaisse nuit tout a coup m'environne?':46 The night spoken of
here (and hinted at in the repeated shades of blue) is literalised
when Helene is at her most vulnerable: night falls when she is
penniless and stranded at the airport. To this literal and moral
darkness is added a spatial and temporal obscurity which isolates
Helene even further. Alone and seemingly friendless, she is in an
alien environment, a nameless town, sometime in the near
future. 47 The melodrama's typical longing for the past (expressed
in Helene's reminiscences on the tram) is thus complemented by
a desire for spatial escape (to Paris). Because this is melodrama, it
is no surprise when Paul rather than Helene succumbs to evil,
swallowed up by the black mirror at the end of the film. But
because this is also Chabrol, once also feels that the struggle
between Helene and Regnier (in its socio-political implications, at
least) goes on.



Juste avant la nu;t
The final film of the Helene cycle, Juste avant la nuit (1971) was in
fact only made as an emergency measure, and as such brilliantly
illustrates Chabrol's pragmatism. Two weeks before shooting was
due to start on Ten Days' Wonder, Orson Welles - playing the male
lead - fell ill. The film was subsequently shot (with Welles but

46 'But what dark night suddenly surrounds me?' - spoken by Oreste in
    Andromaque.
47 The mm is actually shot in Brussels. Hence HeUme's mantra about escaping to
   Paris. Of the future setting, Chabrol has said: 'It portrays the world as it will be
   in ten years time if .. : (Milne 1971: 9).
74    CLAUDE CHABROl


without the original female lead, Catherine Deneuve) in spring
 1971. But in the meantime, and in order to avoid a massive loss by
disbanding the waiting film crew, the producer Andre Genoves
asked Chabrol to shoot another film from scratch. Chabrol gave
Genoves three novels he considered suitable for adaptation, and
 Edward Atlyah's The Thin Line was chosen. Chabrol modified the
story and then shot the film in seven weeks, in the winter of 1970-71.
    Despite this far from ideal genesis, Juste avant la nuit provides a
poignant inversion of the first film of the Helene cycle, and
functions as a conclusion to the cycle as a whole. Chabrol's robust
defence of the film also serves to define its form: 'On m'a reproche
de me repeter, d'avoir refait La Femme infidele. Je defie bien
quiconque de mettre un gant droit a la main gauche'48 (Chabrol
1976: 175). Juste avant la nuit has essentially the same setting and
plot as La Femme infidele: a bourgeois family living in Versailles
(Stephane Audran as Helene, Michel Bouquet as Charles) and an
extra-marital affair brought to an end by Charles's murder of the
lover. And each has a Hitchcockian sub-plot to fill out the narra-
tive (the disposal of Victor's body and the affair of the thieving
accountant, both reminiscent of PSYChO).49 But Juste avant la nuit
inverts the central premise of the earlier film. Thus where Charles
Desvallees rescues his marriage by killing Victor and feeling no
guilt, Charles Masson imperils his marriage not by having an
affair with Laura or even by killing her, but by feeling guilty about
it. His desperate quest for judgement from his wife and his best
friend (Frans:ois, Laura's husband), is met with a benign accept-
ance and a refusal to condemn (itself perhaps a parody of Chabrol's
own moral creed). In a typically ambivalent ending, Charles is
killed by Helene (possibly to prevent him from giving himself up
to the police), but only after he has hinted to her that he wants to
die. Consequently, where in La Femme infidele, once dead, Victor
is abruptly forgotten by both Charles and Helene, in the final
scene of Juste avant la nuit it is Charles himself who is quietly

    Michel Bouquet has said that La Femme inftdele and Juste avant
la nuit are 'deux films Oll Chabrol s'interroge lui-meme'5! (de
 Baecque 1997: 65). Bouquet's role as Charles Masson seems to
represent Chabrol even more fully than his earlier performance as
Charles Desvallees. Hence the physical resemblance (especially
when wearing sunglasses early in the film), his 'hantise de devenir
bourgeois'52 and his desire to think of himself as an uncon-
ventional radical (he has written a novel, has a black au pair, wears
paisley shirts, and above all, engages in a sadomasochistic affair
with his best friend's wife). This is in a sense a version of
Chabrol's own fascination with the controversial and provocative
Paul Gegauff, a fascination played out in the realm of fiction by
means of the collaboration with Gegauff on numerous screen-
plays, and in particular via the creation of the Charles and Paul
characters. Although Juste avant la nuit does not exorcise
Chabrol's fascination with Gegauff - that was to come three years
later, with Une partie de plaisir - it does present a Chabrolian
figure struggling with his Gegauffian fantasies. It is as if Charles
wants to become a Paul, but then finds that he cannot maintain
this change of image in reality (only in play). A poster in the
advertising agency where he works declares that 'Toutes les
fantaisies sont permises' ,5l but this is only true as long as they
remain fantasies. In his affair with Laura, and his lifestyle in
general, Charles has been playing at breaking certain (rather small)
taboos. But murder is a step too far. In reality, he cannot live with
the consequences of his role-playing actions. The theme of game-
playing is associated explicitly with the extra-marital affair (itself
parodied by the chaste game of Scrabble that Charles plays at
home with Helene). Described by Charles as 'une sorte de theatre
insense',5-I what we see of the affair is a game of dominance and

50 'the children are starting to forget'
51   'two films where Chabrol asks questions about himself
52   'fear of becoming bourgeois'. This is how Fran~ois describes Charles in the film.
53   'All fantasies are permitted'
54   'a sort of insane play-acting'
76     CLAUDE CHABROl


 submission, with Laura asking Charles to punish, rape and kill
 her. The theatrical metaphor is reiterated by the mise en scene
 throughout the film, which features the repeated use of curtains,
 walls or doors to frame the action. This is most explicit when the
camera tracks forwards through open curtains to show Fran~ois
 being interviewed by the police in the flat where the murder (and
 the affair) took place. In the subsequent sequence, the same
camera movement (this time through an open doorway) reveals
Charles and Helene playing Scrabble. The visual parallel between
Chabrol's filming of the illicit flat and the family home suggests a
hidden similarity between them. The Massons' house - designed
by Fran~ois, who is an architect - although open-plan and made of
glass, is none the less a place of secrets: hence Charles and
 Helene's bedroom (like Laura's flat) can be screened offby means
of a curtain. When, at the close of the seemingly optimistic Christ-
mas interlude, Helene is framed in the background, drawing the
bedroom curtain (with Charles in the foreground, beside the
Christmas tree), the implication is that the family secrets - the
affair, the crime, and perhaps even marital sex, 55 - will be erased in
order for the image of a happy family life to be preserved.
    As with Les Biches, La Femme infidele and Le Boucher, a political
reading of Juste avant la nuit would centre on the preservation of
the status quo by the expulsion (killing) of an unwanted element.
This applies to Laura's death, but also to Charles's (although the
latter is qualified by the suggestion that it might be aided suicide
rather than murder). Both Laura and Charles threaten to stain the
continuity of the blameless and conformist bourgeois family.
Hence the discourse of guilt and innocence, expressed in
metaphors of staining and cleaning, which dominates the film -
as it dominates Betty (1992). In the very first scene, Laura wipes
her kisses from Charles's face, telling him that no traces must be
left. After her death, when the handkerchief she used has indeed
become incriminating, Charles throws it into a drain. His over-
powering sense of guilt is parodied, and associated again with dirt,

55 In contrast with the married couple of La Femme inftdtle, Charles and Helene in
   Juste avant la nu it sleep in separate beds. This only heightens the contrast in the
   film between partly-idealised family life and demonised, dangerous sexuality.

in the television advert for Culpa - a washing powder which, we
 are told, washes away evil. Ironically, it is because Helene and
 Frans;ois are fully prepared to whitewash his actions that Charles
cannot be free from his burden of guilt, expressed by Chabrol in a
 number of compositions which place him behind bars, including
one superb dissolve which superimposes the bars of Frans;ois's
gate onto a ghostly and despairing image of Charles. Ultimately
confessing his crime to Frans;ois, Charles declares that '11 faut
bien que je sois puni d'une faS;on ou d'une autre ... je ne peux pas
supporter de ne pas etre juge' .56 The Christian implications of his
situation are challenged, however, by juxtaposition with the more
pragmatic but materialistic values of the bourgeoisie, represented
by Helene and Frans;ois, according to whom Charles's guilt is a
self-indulgent and dangerous obsession which threatens all of
them with scandal and tragedy. Not only is Laura's death
materially useless, and dangerously dirty, but so too is Charles's
guilt: hence the metaphor of the rat, which is linked with each in
turn (Charles interrupts his son's story about the rat by revealing
that Laura was strangled; the rat is caught in the trap in the middle
of one of Charles's confessions). In this context, Charles and
Laura are simply vermin to be destroyed by the clean-living
bourgeoisie. Their affair associates them with sex, role-play, death
and religious obsession (Laura's Catholic medallion and Charles's
sense of sin): all elements which, according to Georges Bataille,
conventional society considers to be transgressive and undesirable
'corps etrangers'57 (Bataille 1970: 58). Therefore there is a need to be
rid of them, even if it means murder and the rewriting of family
history. Mixing metaphors, one might say that in order to live in
glass houses, the bourgeoisie must appear whiter than white.
    This interpretation is complicated, as usual, by Chabrol's ambi-
valence. Two areas in particular are open to debate: the represen-
tation of the bourgeois family and the question of Charles's death.
With regard to the first, for all the cynicism and self-preservation
personified by Helene, there remains a strong sense of family
unity and of friendship in the film. This is epitomised in the
56 'I must be punished one way or another, I can't bear not being judged'
57 'foreign bodies', Italics in the original.
78     CLAUDE CHABROL


 Christmas celebrations (in which Fran<;:ois is included) and in the
 champagne toast that Helene and Charles's mother make to 'a
 happy family'. As in the family compositions from La Femme
 infidele, these scenes are undercut by the irony of terrible secrets
 (Helene and Charles's affairs, Victor and Laura's deaths), but they
 are also to a certain extent representations of an ideal. It is in order
 to preserve this ideal (from which he is already absent during the
 champagne toast) that Charles has to die. When he makes his
 final confession on the beach, Helene turns away to see a woman
 pushing a child in a pram. This bleak image of a lone mother
 corresponds to the spectral image of Charles behind bars earlier in
 the film: both are virtual representations of what will happen to
the Masson family if Charles goes to the police. It is for this reason
that the film cannot end, as did La Femme infidele, with an opti-
mistic arrest. Instead there is the pessimism of Charles's death,
followed by the final image of the family group, without him, on
the wintry beach. This image recalls two films by Luis Bunuel -
 Un chien andalou (1928) and Belle de jour (1967). If the ending of
the former suggests that bourgeois marriage is like being buried
in sand, Pierre and Severine's walk on the beach in the latter has a
wintry pathos which is similar to the beach scenes in juste avant la
nuit. Chabrol has in fact said that he and Bunuel have 'des rela-
tions identiques aux deux corps sociaux que sont la bourgeoisie et
le clerge'58 (Guerin and Jousse 1995: 30). For both directors the
church, like the bourgeois family, is a subject offascination and a
target for satire. Returning to juste avant la nuit, the priest's prayer
at Laura's funeral is punctuated by the roar of passing traffic, just
as the peasants' morning prayer in Bunuel's Viridiana (1961) is
punctuated by the noise oflorries and cement-mixers.
    As with La Femme infidele, in juste avant la nuit Chabrol miti-
gates the apparent cynicism of the ending (it is as if Charles and
Victor had never existed) by introducing the theme of mutual
understanding between husband and wife. The long sequence in
juste avant la nuit in which this understanding is reached plays on
the title of the film, so that Helene and Charles are in fact debating
58 'an identical position concerning the social institutions of the bourgeoisie and
   the clergy'

who will be 'just' before the coming of the night. When each has
explained their position (Charles needing a release from his guilt
but unable to confront suicide, Helene dismissing him as acting
'comme un fou') ,59 a sudden and tacit pact seems to be reached (as
it is with the burning of Victor's photo in La Femme infidele), and
Chabrol effects a circular tracking shot which physically encom-
passes both protagonists' point of view. Then Charles asks Helene
for something to make him sleep. She fills his glass with laudan-
um (something we have seen him do previously), but ensures that
it is a fatal dose. At each gulp as he drinks the poison, she gives an
involuntary start. Finally, they lie in their separate beds, holding
hands (Charles in loud crimson, Helene in innocent white).
Charles asks his wife 'Fais la nuit',6o and the image fades to black.
What makes this scene, and the entire film, particularly ironic and
sad, is that the love Helene and Charles share has resulted quite
simply in his death, and his disappearance from even his children's
memory.
     In the films of the Helene cycle Chabrol undertakes a question-
ing of bourgeois values within the apparently reassuring form of
classical realist cinema. There is ambivalence and disquiet here,
but it is beneath the surface (the surface is glossy and appears
unproblematic). But what is perhaps most unsettling about the
cycle is the evasion of closure in the endings. Will Why kill Paul in
Les Biches? Does La Femme infidele end happily or not? In Que la
bete meure, did Charles kill Paul and will he kill himself? Can
Helene ever return to her place in the village community of Le
Boucher? Does La Rupture signal the end of Helene's battle with
Regnier? And in Juste avant la nuit, is Charles's death 'just' or not?
Chabrol has said of his characteristically ambivalent endings that
TarrHe toujours le film avant la scene finale. rai toujours prefere
que la boucle de l'histoire ne se ferme pas completement'61
(Bocquet 1997: 96). The ambivalence is all the more disquieting

59 'like a madman'. Compare Charles's final statement to Helene in La Femme
   infidele: 'le t'aime comme un fou [I love you madly]'.
60 'Make it dark'
61 'I always stop the film before the final scene. I've always preferred it when the
   story does not come completely full circle'

since Chabrol is operating within classical narrative cinema, and
within the 'system' (of representation, production and distribution).
This fact, and his use of popular genres (melodrama, thriller, even
romance and vampire film) ensured that with the Helene cycle
Chabrol could reach (and subvert the assumptions of) a greater
audience than his more experimental ex-new-wave colleagues. For
instance, while Godard's Tout va bim (1972), although intended to
attract audiences of IOO,OOO via the appeal of Jane Fonda and
Yves Montand, was watched by only 30,000, Chabrol's Que la bite
meure, Le Boucher and La Rupture (none of which could boast a
major star) each attracted over 200,000 spectators in Paris alone
(Braucourt 1971: 177). After the disappointments of the I960s,
when his films seemed to be either artistically successful (Les
Bonnes Femmes, L'Oei! du malin) or commercially so (the Tigres, La
Ligne de demarcation), but never both at once, the Helene cycle
brilliantly fulfilled both of these criteria, so fundamental to
Chabrol's vision of cinema.

Family plots



Chabrol's depiction of the middle classes usually concentrates on
the family. The rituals of the bourgeois household, above all those
of the dinner table, are the focus for his dissection of manners and
morals in A double tour (I959), La Muette (I965), La Femme infidele
(I968) and Que la bite meure (I969). If the Helene cycle as a whole
tends to balance satire with idealisation, La Muette presents a
resolutely satirical picture of the bourgeois family. This short film
stars Chabrol and his wife, Stephane Audran, as wealthy and ego-
centric parents who continually ignore their young son. (It is thus
a preparatory sketch for the family crisis in La Femme infidele.)
Chabrol and Audran overact with relish, exaggerating the grotes-
que and self-obsessed nature of their characters. When the son
returns home from school, his mother appears to ask him a
number of questions about his day, until we see that she is actually
speaking on the phone to a friend. The son is equally marginalised
in the dinner scene, from which he seems at first to be absent (the
focus is on the father's unsavoury manners) until a slight shift of
the camera reveals him sitting silently at the table. The satire ends
with deliberate malice as the son, having been ignored for so long,
stuffs his ears so that he won't have to listen to his parents any
longer; in the final scene, his mother falls down the stairs but he is
unable to hear her dying cries and walks innocently out of the
house.
   As we saw in the last chapter, La Rupture (I970) is in several
ways a sequel to La Muette, not least in its entirely negative
                                                 FAMILY PLOTS      83

portrayal of the grande bourgeoisie, here represented by the
powerful Regnier household with whom the 'uneducated' and
'vulgar' ex-stripper and barmaid Helene is engaged in a custody
battle which seems more like class war. It is however in a number
of films made after the Helene cycle that Chabrol develops his
depiction of the bourgeois family. In particular, the I970S saw
him repeatedly address the role of fathers within the family.
Where the melodrama is traditionally associated with representa-
tions of motherhood, and is used by Chabrol to address questions
of maternity in La Rupture and again later in Une affaire de femmes
(I988), the thriller - with its conventional emphasis on male figures
of authority - is the generic vehicle for most of the explorations of
fatherhood we are about to consider.



Ten Days' Wonder
Ten Days' Wonder (I97I) (also known as La Decade prodigieuse)
invokes that basic paradigm of family tensions and of mystery
thrillers, the Oedipus myth. Although it features a Charles, a Paul
and an Helene, it represents a break with the Helene cycle in
several ways. Filmed in English, with two major American stars in
Orson Welles and Anthony Perkins, it concentrates not on any
rivalry between Paul and Charles for Helene, but on the nature of
patriarchal authority, embodied by the omnipotent and tyrannical
paterJamilias, Theo van Horn (Orson Welles). It is thus the first in
a series of films - including Les Noces rouges (I973), Une partie de
plaisir (I975), Blood Relatives (I978) and Poulet au vinaigre (I985) -
which explore paternal role models (usually to find them wanting).
Moreover, in the character of Paul Regis - a detective in the Ellery
Queen source novel, recast by Chabrol as a philosophy professor-
Ten Days' Wonder introduces the prototype of the detective·as-
surrogate-father, a character who reappears in a less compromised
form as Steve Carella in Blood Relatives, and as Jean Lavardin in
Poulet au vinaigre and its film and television sequels.
   Ten Days' Wonder has been described as 'the screen's first theo-
logical thriller' (Dawson I972: 227). It concerns the machinations
84      CLAUDE CHABROL


 of the powerful and god-like Theo to destroy his son Charles
 (Perkins) in revenge for having an affair with Theo's wife, Helene.
The outsider in this neurotic household, Paul (Michel Piccoli), is
 just another pawn in Theo's plan - an intellectual called in to
witness Charles's erratic behaviour and the fascinating pattern of
his supposed crimes (Theo frames Charles so that it appears as if
he has broken each of the Ten Commandments in turn). The
Oedipal triangle in the HIm centres on father-son tensions rather
than mother-son incest (in fact, there is no incest as such, since
Helene is Charles's step-mother). Theo is characterised as both
Zeus and the vengeful God of the Old Testament, while Charles
becomes alternatively Oedipus, Adam (naked in the garden with
Helene as Eve) and Christ (abandoned by his father at the time of
his despair, and dying in a suicide which looks like a crucifIxion).
Father-son relations in the mm are also articulated by reference
to the work of Franz Kafka. Hence the stem, unforgiving father
and the rebellious yet timid and deeply unhappy son. Georges
Bataille has observed that 'Kafka wanted to entitle his entire work
"Attempts to escape the paternal sphere" ... What he really wanted
was to live within the paternal sphere - as an exile" (Bataille 1990:
156-7). This expresses Charles's dilemma: striving to break free
from the authoritarian father, yet also in awe of him, declaring
that 'He gave me all he had: A potential escape route is provided
by Paul, a rational, atheistic surrogate father who was responsible
in the past for breaking down Charles's faith and his fIXation with
Theo ('I took your God away'). But although Charles and Paul are
identifIed with each other through dress, and later through the
one's confession to the other, Charles is unable - or unwilling - to
escape the paternal sphere. He chooses to return to the paternal
home from the alienating freedom of Paris. And once there, it is
ironically Paul just as much as Theo who drives him to his death.
The Kafkaesque resonance ofTen Days' Wonder, from the opening
scene of Charles waking in the hotel room to the central father-
son relationship, is enhanced by Chabrol's casting. The pairing of
Welles and Perkins evokes Welles's 1962 mm of The Trial, in

I    Italics in original.

which Perkins plays the victimised Joseph K., while Welles him-
self is an omnipotent presence, both on and off-screen, in his role
as the advocate (associated with 'the scriptures of the Law' just as
Theo is with the Old Testament) and as the film's auteur. Welles's
instantly recognisable voice closes The Trial - with the supreme
auteurist statement 'I played the Advocate, and wrote and directed
this film: my name is Orson Welles' - just as it introduces Ten
 Days' Wonder.
    The mise en scene of Ten Days' Wonder is almost exaggeratedly
baroque, with ornate camera movements, luscious photography
and opulent decor. The action tends to be bathed in blue light (the
opening sequence in Paris, the exterior and nocturnal scenes in
Alsace) or set in heavily stylised and predominantly blue interiors
(the van Horn mansion; the hotels where the blackmail sub-plot
develops). These characteristics recall the formal mise en scene of
the HelE~ne cycle generally, and specifically Chabrol's use of colour
in La Rupture. Theo van Horn's all-pervasive patriarchal presence
is expressed, even in his absence, by the ubiquitous colour blue, as
is Regnier's in La Rupture and, later, Philippe's in Une partie de
plaisir. Thus even when Charles van Horn is in Paris, miles from
his father, he - and indeed the entire city - is shadowed in blue
light, just as Helene staying in the guesthouse is still subject to
Regnier's influence, symbolised by the overpowering blue decor
of her room. (Moreover, the blue decor of the hotels in Ten Days'
Wonder, as much as the enigmatic voice on the telephone, sug-
gests that Theo is the unseen blackmailer.) In some ways an
exaggeration of WelIes himself, Theo can also be seen as a hyper-
bolic parody of Chabrol-as-auteur, indulging his omnipotence in
the manipulation of characters and the weaving of events into a
formal pattern. In his later films on a paternal theme - notably
Blood Relatives and Poulet au vinaigre - Chabrol uses the figure of
the detective as a kind of alter ego. But in Ten Days' Wonder, Paul
is far too compromised, both as a truth-seeking investigator and as
a surrogate father, to fulfil that role. Asked by Charles and Helene
to listen to their confession but not to judge them, he cannot
prevent himself from making a (disastrously wrong) judgement.
Seduced by the formal pattern of the crimes he has witnessed,
86      CLAUDE CHABROL


Paul convinces Charles that he is guilty of Helene's murder and
thus provokes his suicide. When, a year later, Paul realises his
mistake, he has to accept responsibility for Helene and Charles's
deaths. Like Theo, he too has been 'sitting in judgement on [his]
puppets below'. Where in Poulet au vinaigre the detective will free
his surrogate son from guilt by absolving him of a murder he did
commit, in Ten Days' Wonder the detective kills his surrogate son
by condemning him for a murder he did not.



Les Noces rouges
As we saw with regard to Juste avant la nuit (1971), Chabrol has
compared his own attitude to the bourgeoisie with that of the
surrealist film-maker Luis Bufiuel. In 1972, Chabrol's wife,
Stephane Audran, appeared in Bufiuel's Le Charme discret de la
bourgeoisie, a satire about six well-heeled characters in search of a
dinner party. Audran has said that after this film, she started
telling Chabrol how Bufiuel would have tackled a given scene: 'Je
comparais: "Tiens, Bufiuel aurait fait ci. Tiens, Bufiuel aurait fait
c;:a'''' (Grassin and Bernard 1991: 58). Whether as a result of his
wife's prompting or not, when in 1973 Chabrol wrote and filmed
Les Noces rouges (1973), he made it a satire on the bourgeoisie very
much in the manner of Bufiuel. The film stars four of the cast of
Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie, and combines a thriller plot
derived from a real-life case (the Bourganeuf murders) with the
portrayal of a corrupt Gaullist mayor. The film's release was
delayed, on the pretext that it might prejudice the Bourganeuf
murder trial. But as Chabrol points out, as soon as the elections of
April 1973 had taken place, the film was mysteriously released
(Chabrol 1976: 176). In fact, Les Noces rouges works most success-
fully neither as a political comment nor as a realistic thriller, but
as a satire on bourgeois adultery and as a hyperbolic version of Le
Charme discret de la bourgeoisie.

    In Buftuel's fllm, Stephane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel (Paul
Thomas from La Rupture) play Madame and Monsieur Senechal,
a couple caught between the codes of bourgeois behaviour and the
desires that lie underneath. Early in the film they ignore their
newly arrived guests and climb down a trellis in order to have sex
in the garden. When they return, brushing grass from their clothes
and hair, their guests have disappeared (to be replaced by a bishop
seeking a job as a gardener). In a later scene, Madame Thevenot
(Delphine Seyrig) and the Ambassador of Miranda (Fernando
Rey) engage in frantic foreplay under Monsieur Thevenot's nose.
Both of these sequences are echoed in exaggerated form by the
frenetic bourgeois adultery of Les Noces rouges. Saddled with undesir-
able partners (an impotent husband and a sickly wife), Lucienne
(Audran) and Pierre (Michel Piccoli, the corrupt government mini-
ster in Le Charme discret), embark on a passionate affair. Chabrol
increases the absurdity of this situation in several ways. Firstly,
Lucienne's husband Paul (daude Pieplu, the colonel from Le
Channe discret) is the local mayor and also Pierre's boss. Hence the
comic scene in which, immediately after the lovers have sex in the
drawing-room of a chateau, Pierre has to sit next to Paul at a meeting
while the mayor blames the desecration of the chateau on teenage
tearaways. Moreover, Audran and Piccoli overact furiously in their
love scenes, while Chabrol tends to shoot their affair with suspense-
ful music and sudden tracking shots. The sex scenes are never
private and are often outside, as in the consummation of the affair
by the lakeside, when Lucienne and Pierre are forced to hide in the
bushes while a boat approaches. Chabrol had hinted at the farcical
nature of bourgeois adultery in La Muette, where he himself played
a pere de famille having an affair with the maid. At the time, he
remarked that 'il y a tout le cote folie sexuelle de la bourgeoisie. Les
"folies bourgeoises", on pense que c'est de la rigolade, mais c'est
vrai!'J (Braucourt I97I: II2). In the first half of Les Noces rouges,
these 'folies bourgeoises' are more evident and more ridiculous
than anywhere else in Chabrol's work. 4
3 'there is the entire question ofthe bourgeoisie's mad sexual passion. You might
  think that "bourgeois passion" is a just a joke, but it's true!'
4 Except perhaps f<)r the film of the same title. See below for an analysis of Folies
  bourgeoises (1976).
88    CLAUDE CHABROL


    After Pierre kills his wife and Paul finds out about Lucienne's
affair, Les Noces rouges changes in tone. Farce is swapped for sus-
pense as the three central characters engage in a battle of wills.
The shifting power relations of the Helene cycle are again in
evidence, as when Paul, to all intents and purposes an impotent
cuckold, suddenly thanks Lucienne and Pierre for their 'discre-
tion' and uses his new-found knowledge of their affair to black-
mail Pierre into backing a crooked land deal. Although Paul is
ultimately murdered as a result (in a fake car accident inspired -
like the Bourganeuf murders - by James Cain's The Postman Always
 Rings Twice), from this moment on he is no longer a figure offun.
The impression created by the earlier sequences (in which he
bounds across the lawn like a buffoon, or snores loudly on the
couch) is qualified once it becomes clear how cleverly he has mani-
pulated those around him. But those earlier scenes (in particular
the shot of him snoring while his wife and daughter laugh at him)
also reveal the weakness of Paul's position within his own family.
    Far from being the authoritative father figure that a Gaullist
mayor should be, and that Theo van Horn epitomises in Ten Days'
Wonder, Paul is the butt of the family. This is partly because
Helene (Eliana de Santis) is only his step-daughter. But it is also
because he represents a bourgeois pomposity that Lucienne and
Helene have both largely escaped, thanks to their lower social
origins. Their alliance against Paul is both a light-hearted version
of Pierre and Lucienne's murderous plot against him and a
reminder of the closeness that, for Chabrol, characterises a non-
bourgeois family. When Lucienne and her daughter sit together
arm in arm on the couch to watch television, one is reminded of
Chabrol's great affection for 'real' families: 'The bourgeois family
is a farce, you realise? It doesn't exist. But a real family, that is
something wonderful' (Nogueira and Zalaffi 1970: 6).5 The 'real'
family is personified by Helene in La Rupture, and is also hinted at
in the closing images of La Femme infidele and Juste avant la nuit.
Each time, the focus is on the mother. Father figures, however, are
more problematic. At the end of La Femme infidele, Helene stands
holding Michel while Charles is emotionally present but physically
 5 Italics in original.

absent, as expressed in the Vertigo shot. The Paul of Que la bite
meure terrorises his wife and son; even in his absence, the family
group is frozen, awaiting his arrival with trepidation. And at the
start of La Rupture, Heli~ne must literally fight Charles to protect
Michel. For the rest of the film, Charles is incapacitated and
replaced by his own father, the megalomaniac Regnier. In Les
Noces rouges, Helene again embodies the true family, but here
she is the daughter not the mother (Eliana de Santis not
Stephane Audran). The father is again either absent (Helene's
biological father) or virtual (Paul, the step-father). If Pierre
represents a potential second step-father after Paul's murder, it
is HeIene who curtails this possibility by innocently bringing
Lucienne and Pierre's affair to the attention of the police. By
invoking the truthfulness of the 'real' family (which has
characterised her relationship with her mother up to this point),
Helene destroys Lucienne and punishes her for lying about her
'folies bourgeoises' with Pierre.



Nodo
In contrast with Ten Days' Wonder and us Noces rouges, Chabrol's
subsequent film does not concern murderous bourgeois families.
Indeed, Nada (1974) might be said to posit a radical alternative to
the family group: the terrorist cell. A group of left-wingers and
anarchists, calling themselves Nada, kidnap the American ambas-
sador in Paris. In the bloody police siege that follows, the
ambassador and all but two of the terrorists are killed. But before
the siege begins, an alternative family seems to be established at
the gang's hide-out in the countryside. Chabrol contrasts almost
idyllic pastoral sequences (the tentative affair between Epaulard
and Cash, images of rabbits and wheatfields) with the violent
urban world that has been temporarily left behind: police
brutality, suicide, paranoia. The treatment of Epaulard and Cash
also contrasts with the absurd but murderous passion of Lucienne
and Pierre in us Noces rouges. Here, the affair is tender and
poignant; it is not even consummated. But apart from this brief
90     CLAUDE CHABROl


 interlude, there is in fact no mutual understanding among the
 terrorists. From the beginning, they act from different motives
 (desperation at the everyday struggle of living, fatalistic despair,
 revolutionary anger, drunken self-hatred), and even before the
kidnap, the intellectual of the group, Treuffais (Michel Duchaus-
soy) pulls out. The gradual fragmentation of the group, their
bloody destruction one by one, and the persistent comparison
Chabrol establishes between their violent and confused actions
and those of the police against whom they are fighting, all
heighten the sense of nihilism implied by the title. Moreover, as
one might expect, Chabrol portrays the state security apparatus as
both farcical and chilling. If, in Buiiuel's Le Charme discret de la
bourgeoisie, the cynical political manoeuvrings of the Ministre de
l'Interieur are comically elided (drowned out by the noise of
aeroplanes and typewriters), in Nada, Chabrol shows them at
length. Ultimately, Nada also shows the recuperation of terror by
the state, as predicted by Treuffais's manifesto assertion that 'le
terrorisme gauchiste et le terrorisme etatique sont les deux
machoires du meme piege acons'.6
    Chabrol had already suggested in the Helene cycle that murder
cannot shake the social status quo. In his own words, 'The state is
the master of he who destroys it, not its supporters. Another
phrase which applies to Nada is: the state prefers its own destruc-
tion, and the death of all, to the revolution' (Yakir 1979: 9). By the
end of the film, the French state has turned the murder of the
American ambassador and the very existence of the Nada group to
its own political advantage. Indeed, as the Assistant Minister
explains, allowing the terrorists to kill the ambassador both alien-
ates potential left-wing support for Nada and allows the govern-
ment to replace the American with a more amenable candidate.
This picture of the state's power to assimilate and neutralise its
enemies recalls the theories of Jean Baudrillard. In Le Miroir de la
production, published the year that Nada was filmed, Baudrillard
describes France (and capitalist society in general) as character-
ised by 'la logique de l'appropriation, l'impossibilite de la depense,

 6 'leftist terrorism and state terrorism are the twin jaws of the same trap'
                                                           FAMILY PLOTS          91


du don, de la perte, l'inexorabilite de la loi de la valeur'7 (Baudril-
lard 1973: 125). In such a society, even death and terrorism are
recuperable, and only revolution is not. The revolution, however,
never happens: it is indefinitely deferred, as in Nada, where the
kidnapping is merely the means to raise money for a potential
uprising at some time in the future. And even if it were to take
place eventually, would not the new order be reminiscent of the
old? As Chabrol has said of Les Biches, 'It's a revolution: the
replacement of one class by another - Why replaces Frederique,
but she does it by becoming Frederique' (Yakir 1979: 9).8
    Nada is not, however, quite as nihilistic as first appears.
Chabrol does not go as far as Bunuel in dismissing all ideologies
as equally futile. In Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie, Florence
points out that the rallying sign for the feminist movement is 'un
signe idiot, comme tous les autres: fasciste, communiste, victoire,
et le Christ est notre maitre'.9 Similarly, the acronyms of the
fictional terrorist groups cited at the end of Bunuel's ca obscur
objet du desir (1977) are all equally ludicrous: POP, PRIC, GRIF,
RUT, GAREJ, PAF and STIC. Chabrol, by contrast, does not laugh
at the Nada group. Their principles are right, it is their terrorist
practices which are wrong. This becomes clear when Diaz (Fabio
Testi) , having escaped from the siege, tapes a message to the press
reiterating Treuffais's manifesto and renouncing terrorism as a
mistake, an action 'consumable' by the state. Chabrol's mise en
scene here is suggestive: Diaz wears white, not his usual nihilistic.
black, as he tapes his statement (see Milne 1974). In the finale that
follows, Diaz is confronted by the police chief Goemond (Michel
Aumont). The latter has taken a hostage of his own, Treuffais, and
anticipates that Diaz will kill his former colleague in response to a
rumour that Treuffais is a police informer. This eventuality would
only confirm Treuffais's pessimistic prediction with a brutal
 7 'the logic of appropriation, the impossibility of spending, of giving, of losing,
   and the relentless nature of the law of value'. Compare Chabrol on the political
   films of Costa-Gavras: 'Tout est recupere [everything is recuperated]' (Chabrol
   1976: 319)'

 9 'an idiotic sign, like all the others: Fascist, Communist, Victory, and Christ is
   our lord'
92      CLAUDE CHABROl


irony: he himself would become the victim of violence at the
hands of both the state and the terrorists. But Diaz's final act is to
kill Goemond and save Treuffais, at the cost of his own life. The
pragmatism and solidarity celebrated in this ending seem to
reflect Chabrol's own ideology of the time, as explained to La Revue
du cinema in December 1973: 'je me borne aaccepter des dogmes
pour des temps limites: par exemple, en ce moment, je me dis
qu'apres tout, le marxisme-Ieninisme n'est pas plus con qu'autre
chose ... ! Donc, partons de celle-ci en ne se faisant aucune espece
d'illusion'lo (Magny 1987: 124). Two decades later, after the fall of
the Berlin Wall and the supposed death of Marxism, Chabrol was
to resume, playfully, this position with La Ceremonie (1995)."



Les Innocents aux mains sales; Folies bourgeoises
Les Innocents aux mains sales (1975) shares with us Noces rouges a
plot derived from The Postman Always Rings Twice, elements of
farce, a concern with sexual power and impotence, and actors
fresh from working with Bunuel. Here, the latter play minor
characters: both Franc;:ois Maistre (the detective Damy) and Jean
Rochefort (the aptly named lawyer, Albert Legal) had appeared the
year before in Bunuel's Le Fantome de la liberte (1974). Their droll
commentaries and eccentricities lend Chabrol's film a farcical
edge, which is particularly strong in the pairing of Maistre and
Pierre Santini as two comic detectives. Moreover, the phone
conversation gag at the end of the film is taken directly from Le
Charme discret de la bourgeoisie, where again it features Maistre as
an incredulous policeman. But the comedy in Les Innocents aux
mains sales remains peripheral to the central plot, a convoluted
and blackly ironic story of adultery and murder. For all its comedy
turns, Les Innocents aux mains sales is also afilm noir.

     Although it can be defined, historically speaking, as a film
 movement limited to Hollywood in the 1940s,film noir has proved
 extremely influential on subsequent generations of film-makers,
 including those of the French new wave. The main legacy offilm
 noir is found in certain character types - the vulnerable and con-
 fused private eye, the seductive but dangerous femme fatale - and
 in the use of expressionism -looming shadows, unsettling camera
 angles - to evoke a chaotic and amoral universe. Film noir 'founds
 itself upon the absence of the family', and presents 'family
 relations as broken, perverted, peripheral or impossible' (Harvey
 1980: 25). It is peopled by impotent or crippled husbands and
 childless couples (ibid.: 29, 33). In short, the family in film noir is a
 sterile and sick place. For wanting to escape this claustrophobic,
 desexualised family space and to fulfill her own ambitions (be they
 sexual or economic), the strong woman (the femme fatale) is
 usually condemned to imprisonment, suffering or death. Even
 this brief account offilm noir conventions suggests how closely Les
 Innocents aux mains sales follows the model. In fact, Chabrol's film
 could be described as an exaggerated version of film noir - or
 rather, a hybrid of film noir and farce, in which each genre com-
 petes with the other. The film centres on a childless couple - a
 rarity in Chabrol's work - made up of an alcoholic and impotent
husband, Louis (Rod Steiger), and his beautiful, unsatisfied wife
 Julie (Romy Schneider). From the start, the emphasis is on Louis's
powerlessness and Julie's sexual power. When a handsome young
 stranger, Jeff, enters their lives, Julie fulfils her potential asfemme
fatale and decides to murder her husband. (She is filmed in a
typical expressionist composition at one point, with the shadows
of trees looming around her, signalling duplicity and menace.)"
After a series of convoluted plot twists, Louis dies, Jeff is arrested
and Julie is punished for her transgression. As the genre
demands, Chabrol's film 'damns the sexual woman and all who
become enmeshed by her' (Place 1980: 36).
    As the film develops, so too does Julie's suffering: Louis's
apparent death is followed by JeWs disappearance. Julie finds her-
self confronted by a series of men (Legal, the detectives, Georges)
12 This image is in fact taken from Clouzofsjilm noir Le Corbeau (1943).
94    CLAUDE CHABROL


intent on mocking her grief for her husband's death, and on
testing its sincerity. The final test is provided by Louis himself,
miraculously back from the dead. In one of Chabrol's blackest
ironies, no sooner has Julie passed this test - reversing her earlier
choice of Jeff over Louis, and choosing to stand by the husband
she had attempted to murder - than she is denied her second
chance by Louis's second death. (A real death from a real heart
attack, rather than the fake death and the fake heart trouble that
Louis had simulated at the start of the mm.) The mm concludes
with Julie grieving, friendless and alone. Her husband's wealth is
now hers, but it has become meaningless. And in an echo of
Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, having originally been found
innocent of her genuine attempt to murder Louis, she is now
implicated in his accidental death. The final sequence formally
marks a return to the beginning. Les Innocents aux mains sales
began with a left-to-right tracking shot across the coastal land-
scape to Julie and Louis's villa, the camera movement expressing
JeWs invasion of the couple's crumbling private space. Chabrol
begins the final scene with an identical camera movement but this
time at night, tracking from the distant lamp of the lighthouse to
the silent villa. Is the lighthouse calling to Julie somehow, or is she
hearing the voice of her dead husband? Her face illuminated and
livid against a black background, she rises from the couch, and
with a kind of traumatised composure walks into the night
towards the flashing white light of the lighthouse. The camera
tracks forwards into darkness and the light is flXed in a freeze-
frame as the credits begin. In this hallucinatory moment, Julie
and Louis have become comparable with the tragically separated
couples at the end of La Femme infidele, Le Boucher, and Folies bour-
geoises, and are in stark contrast with the adulterers so absurdly
and literally shackled to each other in the final shot of Les Noces
rouges. But Julie's isolation and imprisonment here remains a
punishment, an excessive version of the typical film noir ending in
which thefommefatale 'must be confined' (ibid.: 46). Itis excessive
and poignantly ironic because Julie - unlike, say, the fomme fatale
in Mildred Pierce (1945) - has no husband to return to, yet wishes
she had.

    like Les Noces rouges, and many of Chabrol's films since Les
Biches in 1967, Les Innocents aux mains sales explores the changing
power relations within a triangle of characters. A new edge is
provided not only by the exceptional number of twists in the plot,
but also by the erotic charge of the film. us Innocents aux mains
sales is about sexual power, and conveys this with as much
eroticism as anything in Chabrol, whose habitually reserved
representation of sex has been commented on by critics (Wood
and Walker 1970: 104). Although sexual power at first resides with
the femme fatale, it is later transferred to her once-impotent
husband. The key to the depiction of desire in the film is scopo-
philia, the power of the gaze. Hence where Paul, the cuckolded
and impotent husband in Les Noces rouges, regains his control over
his wife and her lover by means of political blackmail, in Les
Innocents aux mains sales Louis does so simply by spying on them.
And although both men end up dead, Paul dies without ever
having regained his sexual potency, while Louis achieves a com-
plete sexual rebirth through voyeurism. As he tells Julie on his
return from the grave, Jeff and Julie's plan to murder him has in
fact only resulted in his rejuvenation: 'grace avous je suis vivant.
Et j'aime la vie."} Cured of his impotence, he proceeds to institute
'des relations nouvelles"4 in their marriage and, for all his cyni-
cism and cruelty (he pays Julie to have sex with him), he thereby
cements a new bond of sexual and emotional depth between
husband and wife. The real mystery in the film is ultimately not
the startling reappearance of first Louis and then Jeff when each
was supposed dead, but the restoration of Louis's sexual power
through the act oflooking.
   The theme of sexual predation and Julie's status as the object of
male desire is expressed in the first scene, where JeWs kite (a red
bird of prey) lands suggestively on her as she lies sunbathing
naked. This is followed by Jerrs visit to the couple's home in the
evening. Both of these scenes end with a close-up ofJulie's naked
back as the opening credits roll. Finally, the third and crucial part
of the credit sequence sees a brief and, it is later revealed,
]3 'thanks to you two. I'm alive. And I love life'
]4 'a new relationship'
96    CLAUDE CHABROL


 deliberately exaggerated exposition of Louis's impotence and
alcoholism in front of Jeff. Once Louis has staggered upstairs to
 bed, Jeff and Julie have sex on the rug, during which Chabrol's
signature ('Un film de Claude Chabrol')'5 is superimposed on a
facial close-up of the two lovers. What makes this last scene so
important to the plot of the film and indeed to an appreciation of
Chabrol's film-making technique in general. is the nature of the
camera shot used. As Julie walks on to the rug and lies down on it,
pulling her dress up over her thighs, Chabrol shoots from a high
angle not used before in the film. Moreover, he zooms in on
Julie's face as Jeff climbs on top of her and they begin to have sex.
Both the intensity of the zoom (suggesting heightened emotion of
some kind) and the precise angle of the shot (seemingly filmed
from the top of the staircase) may appear just a little curious, but
none the less the impression remains that the scene is still being
shot objectively, from the point of view of the camera rather than
that of a particular character. But what appears as objective
camera here is later revealed as subjective (just as Steiger's slightly
hammy performance in the first sequence is later revealed as an
act intended to test his wife). On his reappearance towards the end
of the film, Louis tells Julie that he suspected her and Jeff's
intentions from the beginning, and that he watched them make
love from the top of the stairs. This is the cue for a flashback of the
sex scene, again seem from the high angle which is now identified
as Louis's point of view. As Louis explains the ruse by which he
escaped murder and apparently killed Jeff himself, the camera
circles round the staircase, now the site of power in the film. It was
here tha t Louis turned from a drunken victim to a cunning voyeur,
and it is also from a superior position on the stairs that he reveals
the truth to Julie, who stands below him. He explains that his
sexual impotence was cured by this act of voyeurism, and then
requires Julie to have sex with him in the very same place, on the
rug. In a prediction of the closing sequence, the femme fatale has
been 'confined', put back in her place.
    Ies Innocents aux mains sales was the last of Chabrol's films to
be produced by Andre Genoves, whose company Les Films La
15 'A film by Claude Chabrol'
                                                           FAMILY PLOTS         97

 Boetie had helped to finance all of Chabrol's work between 1967
and 1975. It might therefore be said to bring to a close a particular
chapter in his career, one which, most critics agree, stands as his
most consistently successful period. This sense of closure is
heightened by Folies bourgeoises (1976), a little-known and little-
liked film which in fact parodies the thematic and formal con-
cerns of the Genoves years. More precisely, Folies bourgeoises is an
outlandish parody of Les Innocents aux mains sales and Les Noces
rouges: hence the plot centres on a love triangle and an impotent
husband. The eroticism and the hallucinatory final vision of Les
Innocents aux mains sales are here exaggerated to the point of the
grotesque in several fantasy sequences, particularly one set at the
Crazy Horse strip club, where William (Bruce Dern) finally
achieves an erection only to imagine his wife Claire (Stephane
Audran) cutting him down to size with a pair of scissors. As Bruce
Dern remarks of the soup he is served immediately after one such
sequence, 'it's a bit overdone'. None the less, and again as in Les
Innocents aux mains sales among other films of the Genoves
period, Chabrol achieves a dramatic shift in tone in the closing
scenes, from hysterical (though largely unfunny) farce to a remark-
able poignancy. Such mixing of registers has been described by
Chabrol as something foreign to French cinema: '11 n'y a qu'en
France qu'on ne melange pas les tons. On n'y a pas le droit de
demarrer drole et de terminer tragique ou vice-versa. <;a vient
d'une notion de gout'. He continues: Taime bien ce que font les
Italiens (comme Germi, Risi, Sake, Ferreri, Festa-Campanile),
c'est tres fort. Je crois que fen serais capable de faire l'equivalent
fran~ais, si c'etait possible en France',6 (Braucourt 1971: 119). It is
fair to say that Folies bourgeoises is as close as Chabrol has come to
this ideal of a supposedly tasteless cinema of the sublime and the
grotesque. The film is also the last in his long line of Italian co-
productions, which includes twenty films from the 1960s and

16 'It's only in France that one doesn't mix different tones. Here, you don't have
   the right to start off funny and end up tragic or vice versa. This comes from a
   notion of taste ... I really like what the Italians do (like Germi, Risi, Sake,
   Ferreri, and Festa-Campanile), it's very strong. I think I'd be capable of making
   the French equivalent if it were possible in France.'
98    ClAUDE CHABROl


1970s. But in the final analysis, Folies bourgeoises is more than a
self-parody or an exercise in bad taste. It is also the study of a
married couple wavering frantically on the brink of separation.
Suspicious, neurotic and unfaithful, Claire and William finally
manage to reach out to each other, with very little hope of making
contact. The film ends with one ofChabrol's most moving scenes
(and one he would rework a decade later in Poulet au vinaigre) , as
the camera circles round two statues in a wintry garden, forever
reaching out to each other but never touching. Thus Folies
bourgeoises marks not only the end of the Genoves years but also
the end of Chabrol and Audran's marriage.



Blood Relatives
The generic police thriller Blood Relatives (1978) (also known as Les
Liens du sang) was shot in Montreal. in English, during the summer
of 1977, at a time when Chabrol was also preparing his major
project Violette Noziere (1978). Both films introduce the question
of incest into the apparent security of the petit bourgeois family,
and they do so by emphasising the spatial constriction of the
family home. If Muriel in Blood Relatives and Violette in Violette
 Noziere become entangled in incestuous relationships (the former
with her cousin Andrew, the latter implicitly with her father), the
suffocating closeness of the family home seems to be the cause.
As Chabrol has noted, the family unit is a source of great physical
tension: 'What's frightening is that there's a father, a mother, and
children - they are all pressed together - it's disgusting.... I don't
see how people can live that way - and yet it has such strength. It's
masochistic; they're unhappy but it endures' (Yakir 1979: 8).
Confronting their own teenage desires, Muriel and Violette
attempt to negotiate a private, sexualised space away from their
unhappy families. In Blood Relatives, Muriellives with her uncle
and aunt, the Lowerys, and has to share a bedroom with her
cousin Patricia; Muriel and her male cousin Andrew consummate
their affair in a boat offshore from the rest of the family; her desire
to escape the family is evoked in a slow, desperate tracking shot
                                                              FAMILY PLOTS   99

away from the meal table and down a corridor while her voice-over
tells us 'I hate this house'. She later plans to move into a hotel or
even an apartment with her boss (himself just another surrogate
to replace her dead father and her guardian-uncle). Blood ties
ensure that she never leaves the family space: she is murdered by
Patricia before she can escape. In Violette Noziere, the projected
escape is put into practice, with Violette leaving behind the
cramped flat she shares with her parents to indulge in sexual
adventures in nocturnal Paris. And, of course, Violette is not the
victim of murder but its perpetrator; she kills her father and
disables her mother. [7 But in Blood Relatives, each daughter figure
(of whom Muriel is only one among four) remains subject to the
moral and physical hold of one or more father figures, who offer
various personifications of patriarchal authority.
    The father may be absent from La Rupture and Les Noces rouges
(as the mother is from Les Cousins and Que la bete meure), but in
Blood Relatives he proliferates into a number of characters. The
alternative father-daughter relationships presented in the film
vary from the obsessively patriarchal to the paedophiliac. That
each is in fact a reflection of the others is apparent from the basic
similarities in each case: these actual and virtual fathers are all in
their forties, and the girls all teenagers. Chabrol thus suggests a
number of possible models of paternal behaviour. Ironically, the
most satisfactory of these relationships is that between the detec-
tive and the killer. Firstly, as a yardstick for comparison, there is
the conventional relationship between detective Steve Carella (Donald
Sutherland) and his daughter Helen, aged twelve. Although
Helen remains in the background throughout the film, largely
supplanted by Patricia as an object of Carella's interest and even
affection, the single scene between her and her father is crucial.
Chabrol shoots the two of them strolling arm in arm across a park
in Montreal. As they approach the camera, Helen says, 'I like it
when 1 hold you like this ... Dad, we're like lovers'. Carella's
response is gently to correct her misapprehension and to
maintain that their relationship is a safe, asexual, familial one: 'Ah
no, we have something else.' His correction is important: Helen's

reading of things finds its logical extension in the liaison between

incest. that too will be portrayed in the film. although in the much
more ambiguous light of sex between cousins. But the 'something
else' that Carella and Helen share will be replaced by the shifting
game of trust and confidence played between cop and witness-
suspect. in which fifteen-year-old Patricia becomes Carella's sur-
rogate daughter.
    Chabrol added the character of Helen to the Ed McBain source
novel. no doubt to allow the identification between the detective's
two daughters (one real. one virtual). an identification which he
himself underlines when describing the subject of the film as 'the
relationship of a 4o-year old cop with his daughter ...• but it's not
even his daughter' (ibid.: 7). This process is confirmed when
Chabrol shoots Carella and Patricia walking arm in arm across the
meadow. exactly as Carella and Helen had crossed the park earlier.
There are two other scenes in which Chabrol's mise en scene associ-
ates Carella with Patricia. In his first appearance. the detective is
framed in the archway where the murder took place; Muriellies
dead where she stood in the pre-credit sequence. while Carella
stands in Patricia's position - on the right and shot in profile.
Later. at the identity parade. Patricia identifies the man she is
looking for (in fact a fantasy since she herself was the killer) as 'the
second man from the left': Chabrol's shot of the two-way mirror
shows Carella's reflection as occupying that position. But for all
the growing rapport between Carella and Patricia (a rapport which
is ironically fuelled by his suspicions and her lies). the composi-
tion of their final meeting identifies the detective with Muriel and
against her killer. By now. Carella has read Muriel's diary. and has
come to understand that Patricia committed the murder. In

who is again on the right. His assumption of Muriel as a second
surrogate daughter is thus not only moral (his investigation into
her death and his reading of her words) but also spatial (he
assumes her position vis-a-vis Patricia). It is at this point that the
kaleidoscope of family ties in the film is finally pulled into focus
                                                FAMI L Y PLOTS    101


and that Carella, correcting his paternal relationship with Patricia,
solves the murder.
    If the paedophile Doniac represents one pole of paternal
behaviour with regard to daughters and sex, Lowery represents the
other. (Muriel's boss Armstrong is an unsettling figure who
combines elements of each; while projecting the image of a
conventional family man, he uses his authority over her to suggest
that they begin an affair.) As Muriel's uncle and Patricia's father,
Lowery is the family patriarch, a God-fearing Christian who
proudly tells Carella that 'family's a sacred thing' and that he
vetted each of Muriel's boyfriends by inviting them into the house
and asking them to shake his hand and look him in the eye. But
the very household that he ruled in this way is the seat not just of
adolescent desires but of incestuous ones too. Although Muriel
and Andrew are cousins, they are referred to as brother and sister
on several occasions, by the Lowerys and Patricia. The incest taboo
which they themselves feel (Muriel tells Andrew 'It wouldn't be
right for us to have a baby - we're blood relatives') is hence all the
stronger. And it is Patricia's repugnance at the sight and sound of
their sexual acts that prompts her to kill Muriel and then incrim-
inate Andrew. Her imaginary account of the murder simply
recasts the violent oral sex scene she witnessed as a killing: 'They
were cousins - almost like brother and sister - and he was forcing
her to do this!'. In a sense, by punishing Muriel for breaking the
family taboo on sex between blood relatives, Patricia is merely the
instrument of her father's will. Her last words in the film reaffirm
the hierarchical importance of family ties even as they imply an
incestuous desire of her own: 'He's got to love his sister more than
his cousin.'
    The theme of repetition which characterises Chabrol's repre-
sentation of fatherhood in Blood Relatives is echoed in the narra-
tive structure. The film is framed by the Hitchcockian device of
the lying flashback, made famous in Stage Fright (1950). As
Chabrol's account of that film points out, however, 'lying flash-
back' is in fact a misnomer. It is not the flashback images of the
murder that mislead the spectator, but the voice-over applied to
them: 'In Hitchcock films, the images never lie, though the
102    CLAUDE CHABROL


characters do. The same sequence shown without the soundtrack
can illustrate the true version of events. It is the commentary that
makes it false, that lies' (Rohmer and Chabrol 1957= 105). Chabrol
himself is equally scrupulous not to cheat the spectator in Blood
Relatives (and also in the flashback regarding Jeff's supposed
murder in Les Innocents aux mains sales). Muriel's murder is shown
in part during the pre-credit sequence. It is then retold (falsely)
twice by Patricia, without any flashback images. Finally the
murder is shown in flashback, without any voice-over, but as a
visual representation of Patricia's confession to Carella at the
farm. Even here, in the true version, the theatricality of the gestures,
enhanced by slow motion, renders the murder as unreal as ever.
   The murder scenes which frame the film, the family plot, the
narrative repetition, the flat mise en scene and the kitsch decor all
combine to create an impression of claustrophobia in Blood
Relatives. But Chabrol provides a glimpse of other possibilities in
the character of Carella. In contrast with the bad fathers of this
film and others - La Rupture, Ten Days' Wonder, Les Noces rouges,
Une partie de plaisir - Carella is some kind of role model. Unlike
Charles in Que la bite meure, who only appears to be a virtuous
father, but is in reality 'full of shadows', Carella is 'a virtuous man'
(Yakir 1979: 12, 5). As Chabrol has suggested, it is in his ability 'to
just let things be' rather than to judge that Carella's virtue is most
apparent (ibid.: 5). Hence, despite his initial revulsion, Carella is
actually quite lenient with Doniac, and refuses to pass comment
on Armstrong or Lowery. Coupling a professional regard for the
truth with a refusal to judge (unlike the Paul ofTen Days' Wonder),
Carella seems to reflect not only a Chabrolian ideal of fatherhood
but also a projection of the film-maker himself. This is even more
explicitly the case with Carella's 1980s avatar, Inspecteur Lavardin,
surrogate father, detective, and Chabrolian alter ego.



Poulet au vinaigre; Inspecteur Lavardin
In a sense, the laconic Inspecteur Lavardin came to Chabrol's
rescue in the mid-1980s. The first Lavardin film, Poulet au vinaigre
                                                FAMILY PLOTS      103


(1985), came at a low point in the director's career, after a number
of poorly received projects including Le Cheval d'orgueil (1980) and
 Le Sang des autres (1984). The eventual producer of Poulet au
vinaigre, Marin Karmitz, tells how Chabrol had failed to find
anyone to finance the film. Karmitz agreed to do so, as long as the
budget was cut from the French average of the time - twelve
million francs - to six. The result was the relaunching of Chabrol's
career, with Karmitz marketing Poulet au vinaigre as the director's
'second first film', much as he had Godard's Sauve qui peut (la vie)
six years earlier (Jousse and Toubiana 1997: 73). Although it
would be more accurate to describe Poulet au vinaigre as Chabrol's
third first film - after Le Beau Serge (1958) and Les Biches (1967) -
the relaunch worked. The critical and popular success of the film
resulted in a sequel, Inspecteur Lavardin (1986), and a television
series for TFI, Les Dossiers de l'inspecteur Lavardin.
    Jean Lavardin (Jean Poiret) is a virtuous variant on the Chabrolian
intruder, in search of 'un petit peu de verite',8 in a provincial town
and specifically within a single household. Poulet au vinaigre is
essentially a film about a house: the Cunos's ramshackle home is
not just the site of Filamo's intended purchase but also, as
Lavardin tells Louis (Lucas Belvaux), the place where the deaths of
Delphine and Filiol, the disappearance of Anna and the cryptic
notes from Tristan all intersect. But the crucial death haunting the
film remains that of Monsieur Cuno, an event which has turned
the Cuno house into the realm of the dead father. Hence the
wedding anniversary dinner where three places are set, one for
Madame Cuno (Stephane Audran), one for Louis, and one for the
invisible guest. Like the van Horn mansion in Ten Days' Wonder,
although for different reasons, the family home has become a
shrine to the past. When Lavardin enters the house (the only
character to do so, apart from Louis himself and the firemen at the
end of the film) Madame Cuno invokes the ghost of her dead
husband, telling Louis to throw the detective out, 'ou j'appelle ton
pere!'.'9 It is in fact Lavardin alone, in his role as replacement for


18 'a little bit of truth'
19 'or I'll call your father!'
104    CLAUDE CHABROL


 the dead man and as surrogate father, who can free Louis from the
 house. To this extent, Lavardin succeeds and corrects Paul Regis
from Ten Days' Wonder: Lavardin will free his brow-beaten protege
from the family sphere, where Paul killed his. At the conclusion of
 Poulet au vinaigre, Louis may have lost his mother (Madame Cuno
is taken to hospital having set fire to the house) but he has gained
a surrogate father in Lavardin and a girlfriend in Henriette. It is
 Lavardin himself who sends Louis to Henriette, both granting
him freedom from the childhood home, and absolving him of
 Filiol's murder. In other words, he lets Louis go twice over, once
in his role as detective and once in his role as surrogate father.
 Lavardin's virtue is that he only finds out guilt to absolve it; he only
assumes paternal authority to relinquish it. However, not even he
seems to realise that in liberating Louis from one emotionally
possessive maternal figure (Madame Cuno), he is simply deliver-
ing him to another (Henriette). The ending is thus characteristic-
ally double-edged.
    In Inspecteur Lavardin, the detective makes a second appearance
as a surrogate father. Arriving in Brittany to investigate the
murder ofhardline Catholic author Raoul Mons, Lavardin (again
played by Jean Poiret) discovers that the victim's widow Helene
(Bernadette Laffont) is an old flame of his. Gradually, Lavardin
assumes Raoul's position within the household, in particular with
regard to Helene and to Veronique, her daughter by an earlier
marriage. This paternal role is only dissolved at the end of the
film, when the lone cop makes his escape under the pretence of
returning to his own family (showing Veronique a fake family
photo). Not only does Lavardin assume Raoul's patriarchal place
in the household, he even begins to take on the latter's authori-
tarian moral position. Just as Raoul is revealed as a hypocritical
libertine in moralist's clothing (trafficking in drugs and sex at
Max's nightclub), so Lavardin becomes involved in a moralistic
quest to close down the club and to correct the activities of Raoul
and Max. Lavardin's new-found patriarchal authoritarianism is
best shown when he tells Veronique to take off her make·up (she
has been to the night-club in secret) so as not to let her mother see
her looking like a whore (,une pute'). Identity is inverted

throughout Inspecteur Lavardin, and it is not just Lavardin and
Raoul who are involved. The entire film is structured on a series of
reversals: the lone cop becomes a family man and the puritan a
bigot; the gay Frands is in fact straight; the dead come to life
(Veronique's father Pierre Manguin, suspected dead, reappears as
Peter Guinman)'o and the living appear dead (the recurrent shots
of Helene sitting or lying, deaf, mute and staring into space as if
comatose); the guilty are innocent (Lavardin absolves Veronique
and Claude of responsibility for Raoul's death) and the innocent
guilty (Max, the target of Lavardin's moralistic quest, is framed for
the murder). And the anti-authoritarian rogue cop of Poulet au
vinaigre comes in Inspecteur Lavardin to represent la loi du pere, the
power of the patriarchal law.

Thematically, the decade or so after the Helene cycle sees Chabrol
working through family plots and exploring different models of
fatherhood. In particular, he represents the family as a paternal
space. Only in Les Noces rouges is the bourgeois home convention-
ally represented as matriarchal. In Ten Days' Wonder, Une partie de
plaisir, Blood Relatives, Poulet au vinaigre and Inspecteur Lavardin,
the house is a patriarchal space. Even when the father or husband
is absent, dead or supposed dead, as in Les Innocents aux mains sales,
Poulet au vinaigre and Inspecteur Lavardin, the family home remains
permeated by his presence. Thus the surviving mother-wife
(Julie, Madame Cuno, Helene), like the house itself, is haunted by
the departed male." The husband's possession of the domestic
space even in his absence, expressed by the family and guests'
ominous wait for Paul's arrival in Que la bite meure, is almost
exactly replicated by Theo's first appearance in Ten Days' Wonder,
and is later developed in the spatial composition of Les Innocents
aux mains sales, where Julie's lonely wandering through house
and garden is anchored by the iterative shots of the spiral stair-
case, the site of Louis's voyeuristic power and invisible presence.

20   The actual process of reversal is encapsulated in the scene where Lavardin
     reveals Pierre's change of name from Man-guin to Guin·man.
2I   In Inspecteur Lavardin, Helene is in fact haunted by her first husband, the
     supposedly dead Pierre, rather than by her second, the actually dead Raoul.

The association of male authority with the power of looking is
elaborated in a number oflater thrillers by Chabrol, notably in the
patriarchal protagonists of Masques (1986) and Dr M (1990).
Invisible, all-seeing and manipulative, they control family,
entourage and television audience by means of an omniscient,
divine gaze, as we shall see shortly.

The power of the gaze



While analysing Rear Window (1954) in the book on Hitchcock
which he co-wrote with Chabrol. Eric Rohmer gives an account of
cinematic voyeurism which is worth quoting at length:
     the theme concerns the very essence of cinema, which is seeing,
     spectacle. A man watches and waits while we watch this man and
     wait for what he is waiting for ... In a manner of speaking, the
     crime is desired by the man who expects to make of his discovery
     his supreme delectation, the very sense of his life. The crime is
     desired by us, the spectators, who fear nothing so much as seeing
     our hopes deceived. (Rohmer and Chabrol 1957: 124-5)1
According to Rohmer, this 'theory of spectacle implies a theory of
space' (ibid.: 124). In other words, the voyeur is outside looking in
at a framed image. To the spatial power of the outsider looking in
- and in Chabrol especially, looking down too, as in Les Innocents
aux mains sales (1975) or La Ciremonie (1995) - is added the
emotional power of fantasy or desire, which motivates the voyeur's
gaze. Hence the subjective nature of what the voyeur sees (or
claims to see): the windows the photographer looks at in Rear
Window become 'the projections of the voyeur's thoughts - or
desires; he will never be able to find in them more than he had put
there' (ibid.: 126). This concept clearly informs L'(Eil du malin
(1961), Chabrol's first exploration of voyeurism, but also
Forestier's perception of Juliette at her window in Le Cri du hibou

(1987) and Paul's visions of Nelly's infidelity in L'Enftr (1994). In
these films, as in Rear Window, the voyeur's 'passion to know, or
more exactly to see, will end by suffocating all other feelings' (ibid.:
125). Apparently in accordance with psychoanalytical film theory,
the obsessive male gaze, dynamised by varying degrees of
pathological desire, objectifies (and even kills) the voyeur's female
victims. In Chabrol's cinema, this gaze operates not only within
the voyeuristic thriller, but also, as we have seen, within the family
plot, where the victim may be male or female: witness Ten Days'
Wonder (1971) and Les Innocents aux mains sales (1975). It is this
spatial and, ultimately, political power of the patriarchal gaze over
a family, a community, and indeed a whole city, which Chabrol
elaborates in Masques (1986) and Dr M (1990).



Masques
The gaze simultaneously demonised and celebrated in Masques
(1986) is that of the apparently all-powerful game-show host,
Legagneur (Phillipe Noiret). Like Theo's in Ten Days' Wonder,
Legagneur's name is suggestive of his status and his authority
over an awed entourage.' Here, this includes willing servants and
helpers as well as Catherine (Anne Brochet), his drugged and
docile god-daughter. The intruder-cum-detective (the equivalent
of Paul Regis in Ten Days' Wonder) is Legagneur's supposed
biographer, Wolf (Robin Renucci), As Wolf's investigation
develops, the rivalry between the two men becomes a battle to
claim possession of Catherine and her huge inheritance. Although
increasingly deadly, the contest is never wholly serious, the ludic
element (the rivals play tennis and chess, and share a love of
wordplay) tending above all to reveal the similarities between
Legagneur and Wolf. Ultimately Catherine, like Louis in Poulet au
vinaigre (1985), escapes from the control of one possessive (god-)
parent only to submit to the control of a younger version. As a
result, like many of Chabrol's films, and above all Que la bete

 2   Legagneur means 'the winner' and Theo means 'god'.

meure (1969), which also concerns the apparent defeat of a
monster by a seemingly virtuous hero, Masques can be read two
ways. Superficially, Legagneur is a crook and a bully, while Wolfis
a white knight riding to Catherine's rescue. But Wolf is perhaps
just as materialistic and unscrupulous as Legagneur (just a
younger version). Hence the parallels established between the two,
particularly in the cross-cutting between them during the garden
scene, and in Legagneur's final warning to Catherine to beware of
Wolf, 'jeune loup aux dents longues')
   The overriding discourse in Masques (expressed both verbally
and visually) is the discourse oflooking. This is particularly true of
the relations between Legagneur, Catherine, and Wolf, in which
power is equated with the gaze and impotence with blindness.
Wolfs purpose, as he tells her, is to open Catherine's eyes to her
godfather's true nature (without of course appearing in anything
other than a good light himself). His own self-regarding nature is
reflected in a series of compositions that show Wolf looking at
himself in the mirror. By contrast, Catherine is unable to control
her own gaze. Her eyes, apparently damaged, are protected by
dark glasses. This poor sight is paralleled by a metaphorical blind-
ness towards Legagneur's machinations. When she does express
her own sense of self, it is as blind and vulnerable (the sculpture of
herself, blindfolded) or as the object of a predatory male gaze:
when she and Wolfkiss for the first time, she tells him, 'Embrassez-
moi, en me regardant tres fort'.4 Ultimately, having transferred
her naive affections from Legagneur to Wolf, she declares that
'Vos yeux sont entres dans les miens et je vois clair maintentant'.s
But for most of the film, Wolfs gaze is no match for Legagneur's.
The television host's authority, originally derived from his
manipulation of the visual medium, manifests itself as a gaze so
unbearably powerful that he has to sleep blindfold, with the
windows closed and the curtains tightly drawn. Like Theo in Ten
Days' Wonder, he seems to watch over his household even when
absent. But where Theo expresses this possibility hypothetically

110   CLAUDE CHABROL


 (saying to Hel€~ne 'I wish 1 could always watch you - and you not
know I'm there'), the camerawork in Masques grants Legagneur
this power literally. In a crucial meal-time scene, from which
Legagneur is absent, Wolf begins to ask questions about his own
sister's mysterious disappearance from the house. The secretary's
response that '11 faudrait demander a Monsieur Legagneur'6 is the
cue for a switch of camera angle from one side of the table to the
other, breaking the traditional 180 rule, as Chabrol gives us the
                                          0


host's point of view, shot from his vacant chair. The suggestion
here that Legagneur possesses a divine gaze, invisible, ubiquitous,
and disconnected from his corporeal presence, is underlined
when Wolf warns Catherine to beware of 'la figure de Dieu. C'est
une figure tres commune, et tres dangereuse') Not only is
Legagneur Catherine's godfather, he also assumes the ostensibly
beneficent authority of God the Father in his own household, and
plays a (falsely) paternal role as host to contestants in their second
childhood on his game-show Bonheur pour to us.
    To these patriarchal connotations, again reminiscent of the
characterisation of Theo in Ten Days' Wonder (although handled
more lightly) is added the technical significance of the invisible
gaze in the construction of fIlmic space. In the scene under
discussion, the absent Legagneur (denoted by the point-of-view
shot) assumes the traditional site of the camera - known as the
'invisible guest' - in the composition of classical meal-table
sequences. Thus Legagneur's gaze is at once the gaze of God and
the gaze of the camera, two figures that Chabrol also combines in
the portrayal of the nightclub owner Max from Inspecteur Lavardin
(1986) and the media megalomaniac Marsfeldt from Dr M (1990).
In all three cases, the conflation of the eye of God and the eye of
the camera is associated with the power of television. The
metaphor is first introduced in Inspecteur Lavardin, when Chabrol
tracks slowly towards the ceiling in Max's studio to reveal a hidden
video camera in the centre of the canopy. The perspective from
this hidden camera, looking down on Claude as he discovers the

crime scene, has been described by Chabrol as 'comme le point de
vue de Dieu's (Chevrie and Toubiana 1986: 12).
    In Masques, television is not just the seat of Legagneur's power
but also an Orwellian weapon which subjugates the viewer: 'Dans
ce dispositif televisuel ideal, on ne regarde plus, on est regarde.
On est situe par l'autre, incapable de se situer et de le situer'9
(Magny 1987: 184). Hence Legagneur's refusal to watch Bonheur
pour tous (or any other programme, it seems). As he tells Wolf, his
own television audience (like the elderly contestants) are passive
and weak, needing 'protection' (read: control). The clips of the
game-show that punctuate the film show that television exercises
control largely through direct audience address: hence the shot of
a contestant singing directly to the camera that starts the film, the
flashing sign reading 'Applaudissez'Io which follows, or the
frontal shots of Legagneur. In all of these cases, and most obvi-
ously in the final scene of the film, Chabrol exploits the ambi-
valence of the frontal composition: it is not just the game-show
audience (in the studio and in front of the television), but also the
cinema spectators of Masques, who are being addressed. This
allows Chabrol to have Legagneur, on the point of being arrested
on air during his last show, to insult not only the television
audience but the cinema audience too: 'Mesdames et messieurs, il
ne me reste qU'une chose a vous dire, du fond du creur: je vous
emmerde!'.II The direct address to camera here works not just as a
revelation of the host's true feelings, but also as a parodic exagger-
ation of film theory which posits the spectator as a passive object
of manipulation by the medium. Beginning with Hitchcock's
well-known thoughts on controlling the Psycho audience - 'I was
directing the viewers. You might say I was playing them, like an
organ' (Truffaut 1984: 269) - this tendency, in its most extreme
form, results in the conclusion that 'The visible is essentially
pornographic, which is to say that it has its end in rapt, mindless
 8 'like God's point of view'.
  9 'In this ideal televisual mechanism, one no longer watches, one is watched. One
    is positioned by the other, unable to position oneself or them.'

fascination' (Jameson 1990: 1).12 But in Chabrol it is only ever
television (and never cinema) which is seen to objectify the specta·
tor in this way, often to deadly effect, as in Dr M and La Cirimonie
 (1995)·



Le Cri du hibou
Masques continued Chabrol's mid-1980s renaissance under the
auspices of the producer Marin Karmitz. But Karmitz refused to
produce or even distribute three of Chabrol's next four films, Le
Cri du hibou (1987), Dr M and Jours tranquilles a Clichy (1990).
While his judgement is certainly borne out by the latter, a deci-
dedly limp adaptation of Henry Miller's novel, and undoubtedly
one ofChabrol's worst films, both Le Cri du hibou and Dr M develop
in various ways the exploration of voyeurism and power begun in
Masques.
   Le Cri du hibou begins as Masques ends, with a framed image
from which the camera slowly tracks back to reveal the presence of
a spectator. In this case, the image is of a young woman, Juliette
(Mathilda May), seen at the window of her house by Forestier
(Christophe Malavoy), a voyeur hiding in the darkness of the
garden. Just as the meal-table shot in Masques mimics the classic
construction of filmic space, so this typically significant pre-credit
sequence refers to the dreamlike space of the cinema experience.
Psychoanalytical film theory has long compared the experience of
watching films in a darkened cinema with the process of dream-
ing and fantasising. Chabrol's composition here -like the murder
scene in L'CBil du malin (1961) - evokes just that synthesis of
looking and dreaming via the darkened space between the
spectator in the foreground and the image of the girl illuminated
and framed in the background. Juliette thus assumes the
reassuring and dreamlike beauty that the filmstar holds for the
cinemagoer. But as Forestier belatedly realises, 'Les images de

     tended to vilify 'the gaze' in her seminal 1993 lecture. Visual Culture and
     Spectatorial Discipline.

reve sont destinees aux reves. 11 ne faut pas les introduire dans la
vie' .') The 'zone mixte et confuse' between 'le spectacle et la vie"4
traditionally inhabited by films tars (Morin 1972: 8) will, in Le Cri
du hibou, be the site of a fatal confusion. Like the professor in Fritz
Lang's The Woman in the Window (1944), Forestier, by projecting
his own fantasy on to the image of a woman, will generate a vortex
of violence and death.
    This deadly process begins when Forestier introduces himself
to Juliette and admits that he has been spying on her for three
months. Divorced, psychologically unstable and prone to depress-
ion, he has found an apparent symbol of happiness and normality
in the image of Juliette: 'Cette image de vous derriere la fenetre,
enfin, pour moi, c'etait une image tres belle, tres rassurante' .'S But
his interpretation of what he sees is purely subjective, and is
refuted by Juliette herself. His comment that 'Vous aviez l'air
heureux dans votre maison, avec votre fiance',6 is met with a reply
which encapsulates Chabrol's attitude to appearances: '11 y a des
airs qui trompent'.'7 Forestier believes Juliette to be happy and
satisfied when, objectively, she is nothing of the sort. Moreover,
he has inadvertently destroyed what little happiness and stability
she had. After meeting Forestier, she grows dissatisfied with her
fiance Patrick and increasingly fascinated by the enigmatic
voyeur. And while she represents for Forestier the essence oflife
(home. family, happiness, stability, continuation), Juliette is in
fact drawn towards death by her growing friendship with the voyeur.
His reserve and mystery serve to feed her own morbid obsessions:
she shows him photographs of her dead brother, and finally
comes to believe that Forestier is the personification of death. His
morbid persona is enhanced by Malavoy's detached performance,
which is based on the theory that Forestier is a man back from the
dead (Toubiana 1988: 8). For all his charm and restraint. Forestier
is indeed a bird of evil omen, a bird of prey like those he habitually

draws and photographs. (When he tells Juliette they must not see
each other any more, it is under the gaze of a huge photograph of
an eagle hung on his wall.) These predatory and nocturnal conno-
tations are complemented by the association of Forestier with the
owl, whose fateful cry is heard on the deaths of Juliette, Patrick,
and Yeronique (for all of which Forestier is indirectly responsible.)
Just as, in L'CEil du malin, Albin's perception of the Hartmanns as
presenting 'un univers rond, parfait, ou tout est harmonieux',8 is
only the prelude to Helene's murder by her husband, so, by the
end of Le Cri du hibou, Forestier's projection of 'une image tres
belle, tres rassurante' on to Juliette has resulted in her suicide and
three other violent deaths. The gaze of the voyeur, apparently
detached and innocent, is nothing of the sort: it is the gaze of the
Medusa, killing all it sees.
   Within this portrayal of predatory voyeurism is a secondary
account of the power of looking, which concerns the reversal of
Forestier's gaze. Although for most of the film Chabrol's use of
subjective camera gives Forestier's point of view, as events begin
to spiral out of control the voyeur becomes an object of the gaze
rather than its bearer. This is first apparent when, in a repetition
of the pre-credit sequence, the camera tracks back from a shot of
Forestier and Juliette together inside her house to reveal a voyeur,
Suzie, watching from outside. By abandoning his position of
power and entering the house, Forestier has made himself the
object of a hostile gaze. The principle is repeated when Patrick
watches Juliette and Forestier in the latter'S house at night.
According to the 'theory of space' which Rohmer applies to Rear
Window, by moving inside, the former voyeur submits himself to
an outside gaze, and to the powerful desires that motivate that
gaze. In this case, the gaze is overtly malicious (rather than simply
misguided, as is Forestier's). Suzie and Patrick represent the
judgemental gaze of the local community, which has decided that
Forestier is a deranged criminal. (Chabrol's choice of setting is
relevant here: Vichy has become synonymous with the paranoia
and suspicion of the Occupation; Le Cri du hibou might almost

have been called L'(Eit de Vichy).'9 The culmination of this theme
comes when, shot and wounded in the arm by Patrick, Forestier
lies on a couch as a crowd of neighbours peer in at the window.
Vulnerable and immobilised, he is explicitly objectified. In the
previous scene, he had complained to the police that 'On a bien le
droit de regarder les gens'.·o But, as the vicious gaze of his neigh-
bours and the fatal consequences of his own voyeurism both bear
out, in Le Cri du hibou looking is a crime after all.



DrM
Dr M (1990) was conceived as a tribute to Fritz Lang, whose film
The Testament of Dr Mabuse (1933) first made Chabrol want to
work in cinema. Released to coincide with the centenary of Lang's
birth in 1890, Dr M was shot on the same site in Berlin as Dr
Mabuse, the Gambler (1922) and The Thousand Eyes of Dr Mabuse
(1960) and is in part a homage to Lang's Mabuse series. Hence the
all-seeing megalomaniac villain, the gambling references, and the
importance of expressionism in the mise en scene. Chabrol's film is
also a topical investigation of its time, as were both the first and
second Mabuse films (decadence in the Weimar Republic and the
rise of Nazism, respectively). Dr M features AIDS (the 'sickness'
or 'epidemic' of the 'suicide virus'), the power of television, the
manipulation of female icons (Sonia) and images of children
(Marsfeldt's broadcast ala Saddam Hussein), the psychobabble of
new-age therapies (Club Theratos), and, most strikingly, the
future reunification of Germany. Shot in autumn 1989, immedi-
ately before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the film is prophetically set
in a partly unified Berlin.
    The conflation of the gaze of God and the gaze of television,
explored by Chabrol briefly in Inspecteur Lavardin and at length in

19   L'am de Vichy is actually the name of Chabrol's 1993 anthology of propaganda
     and newsreels from the Occupation. Le Cri du hibou also features poison·pen
     letters, written to Forestier's employers by Patrick - an echo of Clouzot's
     portrayal of wartime denunciations in Le Corbeau (1943).
20   'One does have the right to look at people'
116   CLAUDE CHABROl


 Masques, is embodied in Dr M by the media tycoon Marsfeldt
(Alan Bates). In Lang's The Thousand Eyes of Dr Mabuse the 'eyes'
are in fact TV screens used by Mabuse to monitor the other
characters' movements. Similarly, in Inspecteur Lavardin Max uses
surveillance cameras to spy on the clientele (especially the young
women) in his nightclub. And in Dr M, Marsfeldt controls Berliners
by televisual means. Not only does his position as head of Mater
Media give him a practical monopoly over the city's television
channels, he also manipulates the masses through the huge
'video-boards' positioned throughout the city. His nightclub, Tod
(,Death'), features two balconies, vantage points from which he
can look down upon the dancefloor and the roulette wheel as his
video screens look down upon Berlin. Marsfeldt himself is part
man, part robot - at Lang's suggestion (Legrand 1991: 41) - and is
dependent on a life-support machine. As a consequence, he has to
retreat periodically inside a technological cell, where a bank of
televisions feed him images of war and death, as well as sur-
veillance pictures from the streets of Berlin.
    Whereas in Le Cri du hibou the gaze of the voyeur inadvertently
causes Juliette's suicide, in Dr M the gaze of the television screen
has become explicitly deadly. Marsfeldt uses his control of the
medium to precipitate a wave of suicides, and hence to generate
TV images of deaths with which to sustain himself. As detective
Hartmann (Jan Niklas) discovers, the trigger for the suicides is a
subliminal message in the video adverts for Marsfeldt's holiday
group, Club Theratos. And, in a variation on the figure from Masques
of the patriarch controlling his female ward, Marsfeldt is the
adoptive father of the videostar Sonia (J ennifer Beals), 'The "Time
To Go" Girl' whose image looks down on Berlin. Throughout the
film Sonia, like Juliette in Le Cri du hibou, is the focus for a
recurrent tension between appearance and reality. She is in one
sense the Angel of Death, bearing the gaze of the Medusa: her
image is both the trigger for the recurrent deaths and, often defaced
with the eyes blacked out, the only clue left by the suicides. In one
striking shot, her silent gaze stares directly at the spectator from
the glossy surface of a 'video-card'. But she is also a manipulated
orphan, whose submission to her surrogate father is reflected in a

series of compositions which show her kneeling or sitting beneath
him. Through her character and its multiple representations
(photographs, drawings, paintings, moving images on video-
boards, TV screens, and the video-card) Chabrol explores the
unreliability of representation as a measure of truth. Even Sonia's
mirror image is a lie, since in Dr M the mirror is not a reflection of
the truth but a false surface which manipulates the viewer, as in
the two-way mirror at Club Theratos. First seen in her disembodied
form, addressing Berlin from a huge screen, Sonia only manages
to replace her own representation with her real self in the
climactic scene of the 'final broadcast', when she 'goes out live'.
For, like an inversion ofJuliette, Sonia is in fact an embodiment of
life whose image erroneously suggests death.
    For all its faults - Alan Bates's hammy performance as Mars-
feldt, the dubbing of several German actors into English, and the
formulaic basis for the plot, in which a lone cop, thrown off the
case, confronts a web of corruption and manipulation - Dr M is a
fascinating film and a brilliant example of how Chabrol follows
Lang in matching style to substance. The film is realised in a flat,
glossy style which tends to rely, like Lang, on a limited number of
(mostly static) shots. This Langian economy of style - particularly
evident in the pre-credit sequence detailing three different
suicides - is also reminiscent of television, as Chabrol has admitted:
     Le principe de depart etait un pur hommage a Lang et au fur et a
     mesure je me suis aper~u que c'etait impossible. Et j'ai trouve une
     autre solution, ... c'etait de montrer comment un style pur ne peut
     que se degrader, comment il peut se transformer en un style de
     feuilleton tele. Car tous les feuilletons-tele - en particulier Kojak -
     ont le style abatardi des films de Lang." (Jousse and Toubiana
     199 2 : 35)


21   'The starting-point was a pure homage to Lang, and then as things developed I
     realised that that was impossible. And I found another solution ... ; it was to
     show how a pure style can only deteriorate, how it can turn into the style of a TV
     series. Because all TV series - especially Kojak - have a style which is a
     bastardised version of Lang's films'. See also Chabrol cited in Gristwood 1990:
     'Lang is an example I try to follow ... Not to use two shots when you only need
     one. No movement when you can do without it'.
118     CLAUDE CHABROL


With its directness, simplicity, and televisual (rather than cinematic)
nature, Chabrol's shooting style in Dr M is immediate and effec-
tive. Combined with the dark, other-worldly music of Hindemith 22
(a rare use of symphonic score rather than the film music of Pierre
Jansen or Matthieu Chabrol) and an expressionist attention to
architecture, the result is a polished but Germanic quality which
again harks back to Lang. The thematic significance of the
expressionist mise en scene is especially apparent in the extended
sequence which sees Sonia and Hartmann make love in his
bedroom while Marsfeldt satisfies himself with images of death in
his studio-cum-cell. While the cross-cutting between the two
scenes establishes an ironic parallel between sex and death (comic-
ally underlined when Marsfeldt, sated, lights up a post-coital
cigar), the decor emphasises a shared sense of imprisonment. As
Marsfeldt later declares, Berliners lead an 'existence defined by
the idea of escape' (here the fact that the city of the film is only
partially unified allows Chabrol to exploit the metaphor of the
Wall). In short, Sonia, Hartmann and Marsfeldt, like all Berliners,
are living in a box. The expressionist presentation of this theme
involves the visual motif of black boxes or checks on a white
background, a pattern which is repeated in the banks of TV
screens at Club Theratos and the design of the police station floor.
In the sequence in question, the black-and-white box motif occurs
in at least ten individual shots, principally in the pattern of the
duvet and the screen in Hartmann's bedroom and in the barred
glass walls of Marsfeldt's cell, but also, more subtly, in the static
shots of Berlin which immediately follow: Sonia's image framed
on a video-board on the walls of various buildings; a newspaper
hoarding with the photographs of six dead children set out in
rows; lines of cars in a traffic jam; a row of square windows in a
block of flats. Ultimately, the entire city is assimilated to a screen,
a box, a prison.




22   Hindemith's works, like those of Lang, were banned in Nazi Germany. Like
     Lang in 1934, Hindemith fled Germany for the USA in 1940.
                                         THE POWER OF THE GAZE            119


L'En/er

Dr M and L'Enfor (1994) reflect two distinct approaches to the theme
of the gaze, as well as two distinct approaches to cinema, via the
respective influences of Chabrol's masters, Lang and Hitchcock.
Where the Langian Dr M concerns the socio-political theme of
surveillance, encapsulated in the metaphor of the two-way mirror,
the Hitchockian L'Enfor explores the personal realm of fantasy,
expressed by the metaphor of projection (in both senses of the
word). And where in Dr M the touchstone was Lang's Mabuse
series, in L'Enfor it is Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), already reworked
by Chabrol thirty years earlier in L'(Ea du malin. In particular, the
scenes in which Paul (Franc;:ois Cluzet) trails his wife Nelly
(Emmanuelle Beart) recall both Scottie following Madeleine in
Vertigo and Albin following Helene in L'(Eil du malin. The genesis
of L' Enfor also has a more direct source in the aborted film of the
same name, begun by Henri-Georges Clouzot in 1964 but aban-
doned after a month due to the director's heart trouble. In 1993,
Clouzot's widow offered the rights to Marin Karmitz, Chabrol's
producer, and the project was resurrected. But while for Clouzot
hell is to be found in 'la relation sadomasochiste entre l'homme et
la femme'zJ (Jeancolas 1994: 65), for Chabrol hell resides in the
gulf between reality and one man's obsessive fantasies.
    In terms of both style and theme, L'Enforis cinematic where Dr
M is televisual. Stylistically, key sequences such as those in which
Paul follows Nelly provide 'de magnifiques moments de cinema ...
qui soudent le spectateur bouche bee au defilement des images'Z4
(Taboulay I994: 36-7). Thematically, the crucial, filmic metaphor
of projection is established early on when Paul, alerted by the
flashes of the projector, catches Nelly and Martineau (Marc Lavoine)
watching slides together in the dark. This discovery first arouses
Paul's suspicions about his wife's infidelity. From this point on,
he moves rapidly from being the object of filming (when Mon-
sieur Duhamel shoots him with his movie-camera) to creating his
own hallucinatory film-cum-fantasy, with Nelly as the supposedly
23 'the sado-masochistic relationship between men and women'
24 'magnificent cinematic moments ... which unite the spectator. open-mouthed,
   with the stream ofimages'
120     CLAUDE CHABROL


adulterous protagonist. At first it seems that his jealousy is actually
anchored in reality, given Nelly's flirtatious demeanour and eva-
sive responses to his questions. Accusing his wife of persisting in
her supposed affair with Martineau, Paul tells her that his jealousy
is logical. She replies that 'C'est 'logique, mais c'est pas vrai'." For
Chabrol, who tends to film the truth no matter how illogical it
seems - witness especially the fait divers films such as Landru
(1963) and Violette Noziere (1978) - Paul's 'logical' untruth is a
terrible error. As L'Enfor progresses, the slippage between truth
and fiction, between objective reality and Paul's subjective fantasy,
becomes increasingly apparent.
    Chabrol's meticulous recording of Paul's paranoia involves
sounds as well as images. In fact, it is the soundtrack which
provides the first indications of his mental instability, and which
most frequently leads us into his fantasy world. Where Clouzot's
original screenplay spoke of 'le fracas des trains qui passent en
hurlant sur l'immense viaduc de fer'26 (Jeancolas 1994: 64),
Chabrol uses the roar of jets passing overhead, complemented at
various times by the crying of Paul and Nelly's baby son, the buzz·
ing of bees or flies, Paul's own interior monologue, and even the
comically apt song L'Enfer de mes nuits ne t'attendrai toute la nuit
/ jalousie pour toute compagnie').'7 The first sign of Paul's
anxiety, and the first instance of interior monologue, is in reaction
to his son's crying, while both the slide-show scene and Duhamel's
filming of Paul are heralded by the sound of jets. That Paul's 'film'
of Nelly's infidelity has its own soundtrack as well as imagery is
made clear when, returning from town in the car, his memory of
the sound of her footsteps is the prelude to a fantasy sequence.
Later, when he follows her from the shore of the lake, his pursuit
is punctuated by a cacophony of buzzing insects, roaring jets and a
snatch of L'Enfor de mes nuits. This attention to sound effects as an
index of the imaginary recalls Luis Bunuel's BeUe de jour (1967). In
the ambiguous ending of Belle de jour, the sound of bells alone
denotes that we are seeing Severine's fantasy, while the image

25 'It's logical, but it's not true'

27 'I'll wait for you all night I alone with my jealousy'

track offers no obvious clue. Like Chabrol, Buiiuel asks what is
real and what is simply a projection of the protagonist's desires.
 But for the surrealist Buiiuel, the implication is that the solipsistic
realm of fantasies and desires is just as vital as what is known as
reality. For Chabrol, by contrast, no illusion or dream (be it personal
or political) is worth fostering at the expense of a lucid realism.
    The course of Paul's descent from jealous anxiety to murder-
ous paranoia is charted by half a dozen fantasy sequences inter-
spersed throughout the narrative. These sequences in effect mark
half a dozen stages in 'la destruction du bonheur d'un couple qui
visait precisement a donner une trop belle image du bonheur'·8
(Taboulay 1994: 36). The deceptively reassuring images of harmony
in L'CEU du malin and Le Cri du hibou are destroyed by the intrusive
voyeurs Albin and Forestier. But in L'Enfor, the typical Chabrolian
triangle is reduced to the couple, and the image of domestic bliss
is eroded from within. This is a process not without its moments
of black humour. As Paul dashes through the town. following
Nelly to some imagined rendez-vous with Martineau, he passes a
wedding scene as idyllic as his own at the start of the film. And the
family enjoying a picnic by the side of the lake as Paul rushes past,
again in pursuit of his wife. are a parody of the happy picture his
family made before his jealousy took hold. In the crucial film-
show sequence, Paul replaces the objective images of Nelly (shot
by Duhamel and shown to the assembled guests in the hotel) with
his own imaginary home movie (complete with paranoid voice-
over. and L'Enfor de mes nuits as theme song). The filmic nature of
Paul's paranoia is reiterated during the storm, when the flashes of
lightning recall the slide-show and the film-show. and thus
precipitate the projection of Paul's fantasies once more.
    L'Enfor concludes with two endings, one in which Paul kills
Nelly. and one in which he fantasises her murder. then recovers
his lucidity long enough to realise that he can no longer tell what is
real and what is imagined. But the clear encoding of fantasy
throughout the film implies that, unlike the cryptic ending of


28 'the destruction of a couple's happiness, precisely for having wanted to present
   a too beautiful image of happiness'
122      CLAUDE CHABROl


 Bunuel's Belle de jour - or indeed of several of Chabrol's films,
including Le Beau Serge (1958) and Que la bete meure (1969) - the
ending of L'EnJer is not totally ambiguous. That the murder of
 Nelly is a fantasy seems to be made clear by the roaring of jets and
the wailing of sirens on the soundtrack, coupled with a burst of
flash-back images which combines objectively filmed events with
scenes from Paul's previous hallucinations and glimpses of the
apparent murder. The most obvious parallel is in fact with Folies
bourgeoises (1976), another film which details the destruction ora
married couple from within, and towards the end of which William
 (Bruce Dern) fantasises that he has murdered his wife Claire
 (Stephane Audran). Here, the fantasy is signalled as such by a
whited-out screen in the preceding shot, and by the continuation
of the narrative, which reveals that Claire is still alive and that
William is merely in the act of brushing his teeth (just as Paul is
shaving while he appears to imagine killing Nelly). But where
William is lucid, and thus able to embark on the tentative reconci-
liation that closes Folies bourgeoises, Paul is not, and consequently
cannot be sure (even if the spectator is) that he has not killed Nelly.
In Le Cri du hibou Chabrol reveals that what the voyeur chooses to
see is a projection of his own fantasies. By the end of L'EnJer,
Paul's fantasies have been interiorised to the point that the
blurring of projection and reality is complete, and potentially fatal.
He can no longer trust what he sees. Ironically, as the final image
- Paul's view out of the rain-covered window - blurs, and he tries
to make sense of what has happened, the last word in L'EnJer is
'Voyons .. ."9

The weakest point in L'EnJer is the portrayal of Nelly as a bouncy,
two-dimensional extrovert (and, in the later stages, as an equally
two-dimensional victim of rape and, possibly, murder). Although
there are narrative reasons for this - to give Paul's jealousy a
plausible origin and a terrifying outcome - it remains evident that
Chabrol's characterisation ofNelly as simply an object (of fantasy,
desire and paranoia) is a shortcoming. As the scriptwriter of
Clouzot's version says:Seulle point de vue de l'homme est pris en
29 ·let"s see .. :
                                          THE POWER OF THE GAZE            123


compte. La femme est un personnage qui vit dans la tete de son
mari'JO (Bocquet 1997: 95). Such characterisation of women is
generally uncharacteristic of Chabrol. but typical of what has been
taken to be classical cinema's gender-specific portrayal of the
power of the gaze. As first posited in the mid-1970s (Mulvey
1975), film theory has maintained that in conventional cinema at
least, the gaze is male and the object of desire female. This
generalisation appears to be borne out by the power relations
between Legagneur and Catherine in Masques, Forestier and
Juliette in Le Cri du hibou, Marsfeldt and Sonia in Dr M, and Paul
and Nelly in L'Enfer. But these are knowing explorations of the
nature of power rather than unquestioning examples of cinematic
voyeurism. As we have seen with regard to Masques and Dr M, the
paradigms of voyeurism (male voyeur and female object) and of
the family (father controlling surrogate daughter) are also
complemented by a wider concern with the nature of television
and spectatorship. In all three areas, power is shown to be in the
hands of men, even if it involves self-destruction ultimately (for
Legagneur, Forestier, Marsfeldt, and even Paul to a degree).
   As his own comments make clear, Chabrol is strongly aware of
historical power relations between the sexes: 'If there are men,
women are the victims' (Yakir 1979: 9). But this has not prevented
him from portraying a number of female protagonists as
confronting patriarchal power rather than submitting to it. This is
already evident in La Rupture (1970), where Helene is celebrated
for fighting against a bourgeois patriarch. The theme returns in
several later films, made concurrently with those explored in this
chapter, but detailing the female experience with all the depth and
subtlety missing from L'Enfer.

Stories of women



In 1995, Chabrol said that 'Finalement, je ne m'interesse qu'aux
personnages, et plus c;a va, plus je ne m'interesse qu'aux person-
nages feminins'l (Guerin and Jousse 1995: 28). In the same
interview, he added: 'Plus on cherche a comprendre, moins on
comprend. Le vertige que cela procure me plait beaucoup" (ibid.:
32). This 'vertigo' - as in Hitchcock's films, including Vertigo
(1958) itself - is felt most strongly in the representation of female
protagonists. It is expressed most succinctly in the dreamlike
images of women's faces suspended in space which dominate
Chabrol's films about women, from the coda of Les Bonnes Femmes
(1960), via the endings of Le Boucher (r969) and Les Innocents aux
mains sales (1975) to Violette Noziere (1978), Betty (1992) and La
Ceremonie (1995). It seems that Chabrol chooses more and more
to base his films on stories of women because he shares the
traditional (male) view that they are more enigmatic than men.
But aside from the Helene cycle - in which Stephane Audran as
Helene is a personification (half satirical, half idealised) of the
bourgeoisie - Chabrol does not use his female characters to repre-
sent abstracts or to symbolise absolutes; they remain socially and
historically defined individuals. There is thus a degree of Marxism
as well as mystery in their depiction. Women in Chabrol's work

I 'In the end, I'm only interested in the characters, and the more I go on, the more
  I'm only interested in the female characters'

 are often trapped, frustrated or disadvantaged, and this is often a
 matter of social class. But the power relations between the sexes,
although exacerbated by poverty, transcend class. The prevalence
of patriarchal power structures means that even Chabrol's bour-
 geois women are generally dominated by men. As Chabrol says,
 'If there are men, women are the victims' (Yakir 1979: 9). This is
 evident in the relations we have noted between autocratic
 patriarchs and their young female wards - Legagneur and Catherine
in Masques (1986), Marsfeldt and Sonia in Dr M (1990) - and also
in the marriages shown in Que la bete meure (1969), Ten Days'
 Wonder (1971), Une partie de plaisir (1974) and L'Enfer (1994), In
these examples, the female characters are usually objects (of desire,
of exchange, of fantasy). This trend culminates with Nelly in
 L'EnJer, Chabrol's least convincing female character, whose life (and
death) is defined by her husband's fantasies. But conversely, as his
1995 statement suggests, recent years have also seen Chabrol develop
an ongoing interest in women as subjects rather than objects.
     Given that in Chabrol's cinema women are often lacking in
financial or social power, there are limits to the ways in which they
can either define themselves or escape their situation. This is
spelled out most clearly in Les Bonnes Femmes, where the potential
escape routes are (in order of appearance in the narrative) sex,
marriage into the bourgeoisie, a career, romance, or death. Several
of these alternatives - notably sex, romance, and marriage into the
bourgeoisie - also arise in Violette Noziere and Betty. Even the
bourgeois love affairs in La Femme infidele (1968), Les Noces rouges
(1973) and Les Innocents aux mains sales are essentially dreams of
escape which do not provide a solution. The persistence of
frustration in a middle-class marriage is also portrayed in Une
partie de plaisir, where Philippe torments his wife Danielle by
suggesting she break the confines of marital fidelity, only to
punish her when she does so. Eventually he kills her for leaving
him. But he also punishes her for seeking her own escape route
from their claustrophobic marriage: a career. When she says she
is looking for a job, he accuses her of 'bovarysme'. By comparing
his wife to the heroine of Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Philippe is
accusing her of sheltering from reality in a romantic dream. But
                                                  STORIES OF WOMEN             127


he is also establishing a key point of reference for many of
Chabrol's female characters: the importance of the imagination as
a means of escape. Although he did not film Flaubert's novel until
1991, Chabrol in a sense had already made several versions of it,
all of them in fact better than the adaptation itselfl For Jacqueline
in Les Bonnes Femmes and Violette in Violette Noziere, dreaming is
their prime means of autonomy; like Emma Bovary, they dream
themselves away from their lives by reading into their affairs a
possibility of escape which will prove illusory. This is true of
career ambitions as well as well as romantic ones: witness Ginette
in Les Bonnes Femmes and Marie in Une affaire de femmes (1988),
both of whom dream of being singers. The importance to women
of negotiating a new identity (be it through dreams or action) is
emphasised in Les Biches (1967) when Why, dressed as Fn!der-
ique, tells Paul that she always wanted to 'changer de peau') Paul
replies that he cannot see the point, to which Why responds:
'Parce que tu es un homme'.4



Violette Noziere

Throughout his career, Chabrol has shown a recurrent interest in
the fait divers or real-life crime story. This is most obvious in
Landru (1963), which tells the story of the infamous serial killer,
and Une affaire de femmes (see below, p. 133), based on the case of
the last woman to be guillotined in France. The fait divers also
informs the references to Weidmann's execution in Les Bonnes
Femmes and the Bourganeuf murders in Les Noces Rouges, and the
implicit parallel with the Pap in sisters in La Ceremonie.5 Even
Madame Bovary could be said to have afait divers at its origin (the
suicide of a local woman was the basis for Flaubert's novel). The
case ofViolette Noziere, which Chabrol filmed in 1978, is notable
in that - unlike the others - it concerns the relationship between a
young woman and her family. In 1933, at the age of eighteen,

  'turn over a new leaf (literally, to 'change my skin').

128    CLAUDE CHABROL


Violette poisoned both her parents, killing her father while her
mother survived. In Chabrol's film, the crime is presented as a
mystery, irreducible to the sodo-historical context or to individual
psychology. Violette herself is a totally opaque and ambivalent
figure: was she a heartless, lying murderer, a greedy opportunist
and a nymphomaniac, or a gullible young girl, duped by her
boyfriend, and the victim - and avenger - of incestuous abuse by
her father? As Chabrol's own voice· over reveals at the end of the
film, the hysterical condemnation ofViolette during her trial, and
her subsequent death sentence, were followed by clemency, a
reduction in her sentence due to good behaviour, and ultimately
by her release, a pardon, and an apparently conventional family
life as wife and mother. She thus came to represent what -
according to the surrealists' interpretation, at least - she had tried
to destroy: the normal, everyday petit bourgeois family. As the
sensational trial and press coverage of 1934 made clear, the threat
to the established order posed by Violette's crime could not be
dismissed as originating in the working or supposedly 'criminal'
classes. Instead, it 'came from within the very ranks of the respect-
able classes and crystallized around the spectre offemale sexuality
within the family' (Walker 1995: 94).This recalls Chabrol's
depiction of sexual tensions, incest and murder within the petit
bourgeois family in Blood Relatives (1978), the film he made imme-
diately before Violette Noziere. Indeed, the French title for that
film, us Liens du sang, may have been suggested by one of the
surrealist poems written to celebrate the Noziere case: 'Violette a
reve de defaire / A defait / L'affreux nreud de serpents des liens du
sang'6 (ibid.: 98).
    Chabrol's increasing concern with female characters as indivi-
duals rather than as types or as embodiments of class is illustrated
by the characterisation in Violette Noziere. Gone is the symbolic
Helene role played by Stephane Audran (usually the personi-
fication of the bourgeoisie, but also in La Rupture (1970) of the

  relations'. The poem is by Paul Eluard and was published in December 1933.

working class). Now the female lead passes to Isabelle Huppert
who, as Violette, plays the first of several central roles in Chabrol's
more recent films. (Audran plays her mother Germaine and Jean
Carmet her father Baptiste.) As Violette, Huppert portrays an
ultimately unknowable individual. The ambivalence of all human
psychology (as Chabrol sees it) is paralleled in the film by the
competing explanations for Violette's notorious crime. While the
narrative addresses the possible explanations - psychosexual,
financial, moral, political- without reaching a defmitive conclusion,
so too the camerawork and the editing appear to suggest answers,
but with the same result. The repeated close-ups on Violette's face
and the flashbacks to her childhood suggest that we are going to
learn something concrete about her motives, but we never do. As
she tells the police, and as her impassive, mask-like make-up
implies, '11 n'y a rien acomprendre') Violette and her crime have
to be accepted but cannot be understood: she is as unfathomable
as her pale, made-up face, as intangible as her ghost-like presence
hovering in the night.
   The tiny, constricted family flat is a recurrent metaphor for the
narrow horizons of the middle classes, the claustrophobic close-
ness of the family unit (also evoked in Blood Relatives), and the
possibly incestuous proximity of Violette and her father. like
Emma Bovary, Violette repeatedly dreams of an escape from her
confined life to broader, more romantic spaces. She tells her
manipulative boyfriend Jean (himself a downmarket version of
Count Rodolphe just as Violette is a downmarket Emma Bovary)
that 'C'est mesquin, s'ennuyer, c'est petit. Moi, j'aime la grandeur'.8
And when her parents force Violette to write to Jean asking if he
will marry her, she calls them 'des nains'.9 Although tiny, the
Nozieres' flat is a place of many secrets: caches of money, letters
and photographs are hidden all over the flat. The identity of
Violette's real father (Monsieur Emile), her affair with Jean, her
parents' sexual activity, her father's desire for her and even the
murder itself are all poorly-hidden secrets which are stumbled

upon in the confines of the family space. It is as if the brutal
 Freudian urges of the family - the jealous hoarding of money, the
search for one's origins, the taboo desires of incest, the violent
hatred of one's parents - cannot be repressed for long in such a
tight space. The theme of repression is most brilliantly evoked
when Violette appears to leave home after the discovery of her
affair with Jean. The screen is split in half by a partition: on the
right-hand side, her parents busy themselves tidying up and
restoring the 'normal' family order; on the left-hand side, un-
noticed, Violette silently appears and stands in the doorway.
Apparently invisible to her parents, she is the 'abnormal' spectre
of the taboo desires that haunt the family and cannot be success-
fully repressed. Although on this occasion she slips away again,
her next intervention in the family space will be to attempt the
murder of her parents.
    Before she commits her crime, Violette is associated more
strongly with fantasy than with action, as indeed are most of the
film's characters. Where the men dream of power (either financial
in the case of Jean, or political. in the case of the young Fascist
seen at the start of the film), the women mostly dream of escape:
Violette's friend Maddy of going to California; Violette of driving
to the coast with Jean in a Bugatti sports car. Monsieur Emile
appears at times to be less a real character than a fantasy of escape
into a higher social class, both for Germaine and for Violette. In
the restaurant scene where Violette begins to blackmail him,
Monsieur Emile is in fact shot as ifhe were an image in her head:
she is shown in a facial close-up, with her real (or imagined?)
father's face hovering, reflected, in the mirror behind her.Io Most
images in the film of dreams and fantasies are, as here, mirrored
compositions. Numerous shots ofViolette show her staring at her
reflection, as when she tells Maddy that 'Je veux qu'on parle avec
des mots qui me fassent rever'," or when she play-acts in front of
the mirror in her hotel room, kissing it and pretending it is an
image of Jean. Photographs also play a role in evoking fantasy. A

photo of Lilian Gish, the great Hollywood actress of the silent era
(associated with melodrama and with innocent suffering) is
pinned to the mirror in the hotel room. Ironically, although at this
stage in the film Violette seems the polar opposite of this role
model, by the end she has herself attained a kind of martyrdom.
Another photograph in the hotel room, showing waves crashing
on rocks, acts as a catalyst for Violette's romantic imaginings. It is
from staring at this that she conjures up the image of Jean, in a
prophetic dream, rising from the sea (like a male version of the
mythical birth of beauty)." Hence also the recurrent dream of
driving to the sea with Jean, and his divine status in her eyes as a
kind of romantic god (when he is in fact literally screwing her for
money). In these dreams and above all her false image of Jean,
Violette is revealed not as a violent monster but as a gullible and
naive young woman. (This image is again reversed, however, by
her promiscuity where other men are concerned.)
    The mirror images ofViolette act, like the contrasting glimpses
of her personality throughout the narrative, to fragment our
picture of her rather than to confirm it. Which is the real Violette?
Or are we only seeing partial versions, reflections of different
aspects of her identity? Time and again the camera switches away
from what we had supposed was Violette's 'real' face to reveal that
we were looking at an image in the mirror. Our view of her is thus
always being revised. In the same manner, the flashbacks to her
childhood that punctuate the closing stages of the film qualify our
impression of Violette without ever proving definitive. They
simply add another layer to her mystery rather than peeling one
away. Chabrol's attitude to Violette might be compared with
Violette's to her (equally enigmatic) mother, of whom she says, 'Je
l'aime parce que je ne la comprends pas'.Ij The final ironic twist is
provided by Violette's gradual change from guilt to innocence,
from sickness and dirt (she is affiicted with syphilis) to purity,
from the sexually-active, dirty and murderous 'red woman' (an
unwelcome spectre in the family home) to the rehabilitated,

   from the waves.
[3 'I love her because I don't understand her'
132    CLAUDE CHABROL


family-oriented 'white woman' (carer, wife and mother).I4
    This development begins with the hospital sequence in which
Violette, in her habitual black coat and hat, confronts two nurses
dressed in white from head to foot. Both the mise en scene and the
narrative (Violette has just committed her crime; she is visiting
her poisoned mother) underline the contrast between the sup-
posedly good women and the supposedly evil one. But from this
point on, Violette becomes associated with innocence and selfless-
ness rather than guilt: she gives her watch to an old woman in the
hospital corridor; she is betrayed to the police by a passer-by; at the
trial, she spares both her mother and Jean (by refusing to betray
the former's secret about Monsieur Emile or to incriminate the
latter in the theft of a ring). Finally, in prison, she becomes a
saintly figure: washing her cell-mate's feet (an allusion to Mary
Magdalene), giving away her food and, in the last sequence,
singing while embroidering a white garment. (It is not just the
colour of the garment which is symbolic. The act of embroidery is
associated culturally with the 'white woman' and, in the films of
Luis Buftuel, with the dutiful bourgeois wife - see especially the
ending of Belle de jour (1967), another film about the potential
rehabilitation of a 'red woman' - in this case, a wife who turns to
prostitution.) It is over yet another facial close-up ofViolette (this
time, devoid of her pale, mask-like make-up, and apparently at her
most real, natural and innocent), that Chabrol reads the closing
voice-over, in which the destroyer of the family is rehabilitated as a
model wife and the mother of five children. The 'spectre of female
sexuality' has been domesticated once more. And - as in many of
Chabrol's films, including Juste avant la nuit (1971) and Nada
(1974) - the threat to the status quo seems to have been absorbed
and neutralised.




14 The terms 'red woman' and 'white woman' are taken from Theweleit 1987. See
   also the account of La Rupture in Chapter 3.

Une a/faire de femmes
 In many ways, Une affaire de femmes (1988) is a companion piece
or sister fIlm to Violette Noziere - afait divers in which a woman is
found guilty of a crime against the family. Both women are played
by Isabelle Huppert, and they share a certain naivety and an
ignorance of the ideological ramifications of their actions. Both
crimes are set against a background of political tensions (the rise
of Fascism in the early 1930S; the German Occupation of France
during the Second world War). Une affaire de femmes could even
be considered the sequel to Violette Noziere, not just because
embryonic Fascism has now developed into a fully-fledged Fascist
state - Vichy - but more precisely, because ten years separate both
the films (1978-88) and the real-life crimes they involve (1933-43).
    Where the two films differ is in the importance of genre and of
political history. Neither has a major role in structuring Violette
Noziere (the film is about a murder case but is not a thriller;
history and politics remain in the background and cannot explain
the case). Une affaire de femmes, by contrast, is essentially a melo-
drama'S which ends up confronting the ideology of the period (as
Marie herself has to do). In July 1943, Marie Bayon became the
last woman to be guillotined in France. Her crime was the illegal
practice of abortion. Under the wartime Vichy regime, a crime
against the family could be construed as a crime against the state.
Marie is tried by the Tribunal de l'Etat because abortion contra-
venes Vichy ideology, expressed in the motto Travail,famiUe, patrie.'6
Thus the reasoning behind her execution, as Chabrol demonstrates,
is political. She is made an example of because she contravenes
the Vichy model of the family (and the key role of the mother
within it) as the cornerstone of the Fascist state. It is here that the
fIlm's concerns with history and genre overlap: motherhood is the

15 I would therefore disagree with Christian Blanchet's comment, in an otherwise
   excellent account of the film, that there is no genre in Une affaire de femmes and
   hence no distancing of the auteur from his subject (Blanche! 1989: 179).
   However, the distancing effect of the melodrama is certainly transcended in the
   closing stages concerning Marie's trial and execution.

134    CLAUDE CHABROl


 crux of the Vichy case against Marie, and of melodrama as a genre.
 It is perhaps natural, then, that Une affaire de femmes should be for
 the most part a maternal melodrama.
     Maternal melodrama is most strongly associated with the
 'weepie' or 'woman's film' made in Hollywood during the 1940s.
 In her study of the genre, Mary Anne Doane has defined melo-
 drama and the maternal as 'two discourses of the obvious'.
 Melodrama makes it clear that 'Everyone has a mother, and further-
 more, all mothers are essentially the same, each possessing the
 undeniable quality of motherliness' (Doane 1987: 70-1). This
 discourse of the obvious is identifiable in Chabrol's La Rupture
 (1970) which, as we have seen, concerns a good mother in her
 battle with her son's evil father-in-law. Although overlaid with
 strong political implications, La Rupture remains a straight
 melodrama, characterised by its moral absolutes, its obviousness
 and its 'will-to-transparency' (ibid.: 71). Une affaire de femmes is a
 much less straightforward case, and as such is more characteristic
 of Chabrol's cinema in general. Here, the discourse is one of
 ambivalence rather than obviousness. This is because the generic
 conventions of maternal melodrama are complicated by two
 connected factors: the historical and political context, and the
unstable, ambivalent status of motherhood in the film. There is
nothing obvious about definitions of the mother in Une affaire de
femmes. Under Vichy, motherhood is a contested sign, an everyday
reality subjected to an extreme political definition. Marie is
punished for attacking that definition (albeit in ignorance of the
definition itself) by her practice of abortion. What she perceives as
a favour or a helping hand for women 'in trouble', the state
perceives as an action against motherhood. But Marie is not just
an abortionist - she is also a mother to her two young children,
Pierrot and Mouche. Moreover, as in the typical maternal melo-
drama, she brings up her children alone, without their father's
help, and directs all of her efforts towards improving their quality
oflife. (One can easily compare Marie buying chocolate, jam and
biscuits for Pierrot and Mouche with the money from one of her
first abortions with the similar scenes from the classical melo-
drama Mildred Pierce (1945), where Mildred buys piano and
                                                   STORIES OF WOMEN              135


 dancing lessons for her daughters with the money she earns - also
 secretly - as a waitress.) So is Marie a good mother or not?
     Within the generic code of the maternal melodrama, women
 are often punished for becoming bad mothers - usually for
 seeking a role outside the home. [7 In Mildred Pierce, for example,
 Mildred (Joan Crawford) begins the story as a good wife and a
 good mother. She is identified solely with child·rearing and
 domesticity: 'I was always in the kitchen. I felt as though I'd been
 born in a kitchen, and lived there all my life, except for the few
 hours it took to get married. I married Sert when I was seventeen.
 I never knew any other kind of life - just cooking and washing and
having children'. This is the starting-point for her (ultimately
 dangerous and doomed) flirtation with life outside motherhood. It
 is also the starting-point for Marie's story and, as one of her clients
 makes clear, it is the reason why the abortions she provides are in
 demand. (Jasmine tells Marie that she has six children, that she
hasn't been happy since she was sixteen, and that 'j'ai l'impression
d'etre une vache'.)[8 This anti-maternal (and therefore anti-Vichy)
discourse is expressed by Marie herself, symbolically in her
actions as abortionist and independent woman, and verbally when
 she describes herself as more than just 'une petite femme au
foyer'.[9 It is most explicit in the bitter mock-prayer she offers to
the Virgin Mary at the end of the mm: 'Je vous salue Marie, pleine
de merde, le fruit de vos entrailles est pourri'.20 In Mildred Pierce,
 Mildred's deviation from good motherhood (her divorce, her
remarriage, her career in the restaurant business) is seen to bring
about her downfall: she loses both her daughters, her second
husband and her business. Similarly, Marie in Une affaire de
femmes is punished for moving out of the domestic and into the
entrepreneurial realm. It is increasingly for herself rather than her

18 ') feel like a cow'
19 'a little house·wife'
20 'Hail Mary, full of shit, rotten is the fruit of your womb'. Blanchet suggests that
   this can be read two ways - as anti·Christian or as Christian - according to
   whether the prayer is addressed to the Virgin or to Marie herself (Blanchet
   1989: 183, n.2).

children that she wishes to move to bigger and better apartments
and to have more money; she aspires to be a singer, and takes
lessons; she starts an affair with a young collaborator while
encouraging the maid to sleep with her husband; and she rents
the prostitute Lulu a room in which to bed her clients. Above all,
she expands her booming business as an abortionist. Marie's
abortion business fulfils exactly the same function as Mildred's
restaurant business: originally a means of providing for their
children, in time it becomes a kind of career, a means of economic
independence and self-definition away from the family home. It is
for this move away from the maternal role that both are punished.
    But Marie's generic punishment as a bad mother (as decreed
by the conventions of maternal melodrama) is doubled by her
political punishment (her execution as decreed by the Vichy state).
This can be related back to her dual status as abortionist and as
mother. The ideological weight of the former (under Vichy) is
emphasised in the later stages of the film. But even in the earliest
sequences, Marie's status as a good mother - and in particular her
relationship with her son Pierrot - is problematised. Pierrot (like
his father Paul) is consistently ignored or marginalised by Marie,
who favours her daughter Mouche. For all the celebration of
female friendship and solidarity in the film (especially in Marie's
relations with Rachel and Lulu but also with her own daughter)
there remains the suggestion (again, typical of the maternal
melodrama) that Marie is de stabilising the family by marginal-
ising her weak husband and her neglected son. The patriarchal
power structures which condemn her to death - from her own
husband, who denounces her to the police, to the male judges and
also Vichy itself, personified by its leader Marshal Petain - do so
because she has sought to live outside male society and the roles it
assigns to women. (It is also implicit that she is punished in order
to make defeated France - symbolised by her husband Paul - feel
stronger.) As Marie approaches her downfall in all innocence, at
first it is only generic expectations that come into play. A growing
sense of unease is linked to her dream of becoming a singer. Just
when it seems as if she might be able to fulfil her ambition, her
world falls apart - as one would of course expect in a melodrama.
                                                   STORIES OF WOMEN   137

Thus she is arrested on her return from a triumphant singing
lesson. But there are also hints throughout the narrative at the
excessive (political) nature of Marie's fate. As she becomes ever
more daring in her affairs (both romantic and business), Chabrol
implies that the guillotine is awaiting her: hence the scene with
the decapitated goose, the death of the Resistance fighter in front
of her, and Pierrot's strange (possibly prophetic) wish to become
an executioner.
    The final section of the film is introduced by a voice-over from
the adult Pierrot, looking back on his mother's death. This has the
effect of mitigating the more reactionary implications that Une
affaire de femmes shares with maternal melodrama. In other words,
the sense that Marie is being punished for neglecting her husband
and son is qualified by her son's commentary. The harrowing
prison sequences - culminating in the shocking execution - that
follow fulfil two key functions. Firstly, they satirise (in the blackest
of tones, but with a touch of humour in the ludicrous rhetoric of
the trial judge) the hypocrisy and cruelty of the Vichy regime
(which, as Marie's lawyer helpfully reminds us, deported Jewish
children to their deaths while executing Marie for crimes against
the unborn). Secondly, they allow Chabrol to comment not just on
the cruelty of Marie's executioners but also, less explicitly, on the
cruelty of the genre as well. The normal outcome of the maternal
melodrama has been exaggerated to the point of excess: Marie is
executed for being a supposedly bad mother. And, as made clear
in both the closing legend - 'Ayez pitie des enfants de ceux qu'on
condamne'" - and the film's most brutal scene (where Mouche
cries out and Pierrot starts banging his head against the bedroom
wall as Marie, sentenced to death, shakes uncontrollably in her
prison cell), the mother-child relationship has been totally lost in
the equation.

Madame Bovary
Both Une affaire de femmes and Les Innocents aux mains sales (1975)
turn genres against themselves in their portrayal of women, expo-
sing the cruelty that the melodrama directs against bad mothers
and the film noir against the femme fatale by exaggerating the
punishment the female characters ultimately undergo. But there
is no such gap between generic conventions and their exploitation
in Chabrol's heritage film Madame Bovary (1991). This is despite
the fact that Isabelle Huppert (who plays the lead once again) has
identified in Flaubert's original novel 'un petit decalage ... qui
juxtapose le cliche et la critique du cliche''' (Boddaert et al. 1991:
133). In truth, Chabrol's Madame Bovary does not distance itself
from the cliches of the heritage genre in the way that, for example,
Yves Angelo's Balzac adaptation Le Colonel Chabert (1994) does!3
Hence Madame Bovary is characterised by fidelity to a literary
source, luscious costumes and decor, the depiction of public space
(the town square) and reliance on set pieces (the ball, the wedding
banquet). It thus remains largely a genre piece, with little - except
for the dark humour - to distinguish it from French period dramas
such as Claude Berri's Germinal (1993). The central theme of the
film - female desire and its failure to find satisfaction in a
claustrophobic social environment - is expressed in several other
films by Chabrol, from Les Bonnes Femmes to Une affaire de femmes
and beyond. Emma Bovary's perpetual dissatisfaction at whatever
fantasy she tries is even comparable to Jeanne Decourt in Que la
bete meure (1969) - dabbling self-indulgently and unsuccessfully
in painting, music, poetry, and eastern religion - and to HeUme
escaping into yoga in Le Boucher (1969).
   All of this raises the question of why Chabrol chose to film
Flaubert's novel, and to add his adaptation to those of Jean Renoir
(1934) and Vincente Minnelli (1949). He had planned the project

     graceful tracking shots to reveal impoverished and sordid - rather than wealthy
     - surroundings. The film itself is about the dignity of poverty in the face of
     hypocrisy and greed.

for years, but the deciding factor was the excellent working
relationship he built up with Isabelle Huppert on Violette Noziere
and Une affaire de fommes. Without Huppert in the lead, Chabrol
would never have filmed this story of a country doctor's wife
whose romantic and financial escapades end in her suicide. By the
time he actually came to shoot Madame Bovary, Chabrol may also
have found that it chimed with the themes he had explored in his
other films starring Huppert: the place of female desire, and the
punishment of its expression. Isolated in a dull marriage, a small
provincial town and a bourgeois, male-dominated society, Emma
Bovary is always dependent on men for the satisfaction of her
desires - be it her prosaic husband Charles (Jean-Franr;ois Balmer)
for her family life, the comically down-to-earth priest for her
spiritual longing, the cynical Monsieur Lheureux for her elegant
wardrobe, or Count Rodolphe and the lawyer Leon for her sexual
passion. Each, in his way - including her decent but limited
husband - fails her. In Huppert's words, 'C'est de cela que meurt
Madame Bovary: de ne pas avoir He reconnue comme une
personne desirante'''' (ibid.: 126). Emma may be frustrated as a
desiring subject, but her desires are also represented as romantic
cliches - unoriginaL fluctuating and at odds with reality. (Stereo-
typical romantic passion is mocked during the 'Cornices' scene,
when banal speeches and the mooing of cows from the agri-
cultural show are heard as Emma swoons in Rodolphe's arms.)
Like Marie in Une affaire de fommes, she is never satisfied with
what she has: hence the scenes in both films where the purchase
of a new house promises the start of a new chapter in the heroine's
life, only for the novelty to quickly wear off. But unlike Marie,
Emma cannot express her desires through independent or
entrepreneurial action, only through the cultural stereotypes she
has learned from her reading (romantic heroine) or her upbring-
ing (dutiful wife and mother). It is between these two poles -
which we may term the 'red woman' and the 'white woman'
(Theweleit 1987) - that Emma oscillates with increasing despera-
tion in her search for an authentic and fulfilling identity.

   desires·
140     ClAUDE CHABROl


    Emma's fragmented sense of identity is comparable to
Violette's in Violette Noziere. Her desires - like Violette's - are
repeatedly signalled by mirror images. Mirrors might be said to
represent Emma's ideal self, her fantasy of herself through the
looking-glass. They are associated with her romantic experiences:
hence the mirrored compositions of her and the vicomte after they
waltz together, and the almost identical post-coital mirror images
of her with Rodolphe and with Leon. The most revealing example
of this kind of shot comes in Emma's first private conversation
with the haberdasher Lheureux. In a composition reminiscent of
the restaurant scene in Violette Noziere - where Monsieur Emile
appears reflected above Violette's head - Emma faces towards the
camera as she speaks to Lheureux (off-screen). On the wall behind
her a mirror shows the reflection of her own head. Also visible in
the mirror (but not outside it) are the shiny dresses that Lheureux
is trying to tempt Emma into buying. The effect of the framing
here is to suggest that in the realm of her own fantasy - the
looking-glass - Emma is captivated by the dresses and the elegant
lifestyle that they evoke. But for once she repudiates her romantic
fantasies and declares 'Je n'ai besoin de rien'.'! When Lheureux
has left, Emma turns to the mirror and tells her fantasy self
'Comme j'ai ete sage'.,6 For the moment, the spectre of the
romantic 'red woman' has been kept at bay. In her final meeting
with Rodolphe, to ask him to payoff her debts, Emma is again
framed in a mirror. This time, the 'red woman' is in full sway.
Emma has in fact recreated her passionate image - wearing a
black dress and red lipstick'7 - from the time of her affair with
Rodolphe, in order to persuade him to perpetuate her fantasy
existence and to payoff the demands of reality. (After all, romantic
images have worked this magic before in the film. The picture of a
ball on the wall of the Bovarys' first house functions in this way:
the image precedes the reality, and appears to summon it up.
Immediately after Emma has gazed wistfully at the picture,
Charles announces that they have been invited to a ball at the

25 'I don't need anything'
26 'Wasn't 1 good?'
27 This is also the image recreated on the film poster.

chateau.) But her attempt fails. The gestures and swoons she
practised in the garden earlier now become frantically genuine,
and culminate in her impulsive suicide.
    Colour functions symbolically throughout Madame Bovary -
although this can be related not just to Chabrol's expressionism,
but to other heritage films, such as Alain Corneau's Tous les matins
du monde (1992), which contrasts warm reds with cold blues.
Chabrol similarly evokes the emotional connotations of red and
blue in Madame Bovary. Hence red dominates in the scenes of
Emma's affairs - her dresses and lipstick, and also the decor of
Rodolphe's chateau and of Leon's rooms in Rouen. Red is also
used - as Hitchcock uses it in Marnie (1964) - to express the pro-
tagonist's state of mind at a moment of crisis. Where Hitchcock
shows Marnie, after she has had to shoot her injured horse,
against a background of red carpets and walls (suggesting blood
but also 'seeing red' and a loss of all self-control), so Chabrol
shows Emma against a bright red background as Rodolphe tells
her he has no money and she realises there is no way out. Blue,
meanwhile, is used to signify the threat of death - as it does for
instance in Les Biches (1967), La Rupture (1970) and Une partie de
plaisir (1975). Emma's suicide is bathed in blue - from the decor
and lighting of the pharmacy where she swallows arsenic to the
colour of her bed and even of the dark liquid that she vomits at the
moment of death. But colour in Madame Bovary also has a cultural
significance relating to stereotypes of female behaviour, according
to which, as we have hinted, red is contrasted with white.
    Red signifies female sexuality encoded as a threat, as illicit
passion (the 'fallen woman' or the 'scarlet woman'). White, on the
other hand, denotes the 'white woman', the good wife and mother,
the carer - desexualised and domesticated. Emma switches between
these two roles in her attempt to define herself, and the mise en
scene emphasises the dichotomy. Red - with black - dominates the
decor and Emma's costume during her planned elopement with
Rodolphe, her liaisons with Leon and, as we have seen, her final
attempt to raise some money. But these phases as the 'red woman'
alternate with sudden periods of repentance, in which Emma
assumes a dutiful family role. While she is playing the good wife
142    CLAUDE CHABROL


and mother - attending to her little daughter Berthe, encouraging
Charles to be ambitious, even sewing on his buttons - her clothes
and the surrounding decor are invariably white or an associated
pale colour (cream, grey, light green). But when this fantasy
wanes, as when Charles's misconceived operation on a club-foot
goes horribly wrong, Emma reverts to her role as scarlet woman -
in this case resuming her affair with Rodolphe the same night,
and appearing incongruously at breakfast next morning (beside
the drab Charles and his aged mother) in a splendid red dress. In
a sense, it is her inability to keep the two mutually exclusive roles
apart (with the 'red woman' visibly invading the pale domestic
space more and more frequently) which precipitates her death.
    The patriarchal society she inhabits can also be implicated in
Emma' s death - but Chabrol makes no attempt to emphasise a
feminist reading of the film. This is due to his desire to remain
absolutely faithful to Flaubert and to refrain from introducing a
(conscious) twentieth-century perspective in the film. It remains
clear, however, that Emma's dissatisfaction stems in part from the
constraint she is under, as a woman, to conform to one or other of
a very limited number of roles. She cannot see beyond those roles,
but nor is she encouraged to do so by the men who surround her.
Emma is also inhibited by her social status. Like Violette;8 she is
constricted emotionally and physically by her middle-class sur-
roundings: hence the small, drab home she shares with Charles,
and especially the cramped dining room (which is juxtaposed
regularly with wider spaces like the chateau where the ball takes
place, or the fields and woods where she goes riding with Rodolphe).
While Emma dies within these social restrictions, and Violette is
finally recuperated into them, the contemporary protagonist of
Betty (1992) frees herself and is able to simply exist outside them
(in a way that a nineteenth-century woman like Emma could not).
Only in the world of the grande bourgeoisie (a vestige of the
nineteenth century) does Betty suffer the identity crisis that
Emma suffers throughout her life.

28 The parallel is emphasised when Violette's parents suggest that she should
   marry a middle-class professional- a chemist (like Homais in Madame Bovary)
   or a doctor (like Charles Bovary).

8etty

 Betty (1992), like Madame Bovary, is a faithful adaptation of a
novel, telling the story of an unsatisfied young woman who seeks
to define herself outside the social and familial roles offered her.
But there are three crucial differences. Firstly, the film escapes
easy definition as a genre piece: its likeliest description is as a
psychological drama, but it is resolutely anti-psychological (we are
given questions about the characters, not answers), while the only
dramatic event, as Chabrol admits, is 'la signature du papier"9
(Jousse and Toubiana 1992: 31). Secondly, unlike Emma in Madame
 Bovary (and Marie in Une affaire de femmes), Betty triumphantly
survives: 'C'est la revanche de Madame Bovary, sa triomphe
finale. Si Emma avait ete comme Betty, elle s'en serait tiree'3               0


(ibid.). And thirdly, this is undoubtedly one ofChabrol's best fums.
    Betty is Chabrol's second adaptation from Georges Simenon,
following Les Fantomes du chapelier in 1982. Even more so than
Balzac, Simenon is a novelist who bears close comparison with
ChabroI, and with whom he identifies (Chabrol 1976: 348). They
share a prolific output (Simenon wrote over two hundred novels,
including seventy Maigret stories), an interest in criminal and
anti-social behaviour, and a detached perspective. Chabrol's objec-
tive camerawork, like Simenon's neutral writing style, presents
case studies of human action without making any moral judge-
ments. Betty follows a young woman (Marie Trintignant) on a
drunken binge from which she is apparently rescued by an
enigmatic mother figure, Laure (Stephane Audran).3' Betty slowly
reveals to Laure how she married into the grande bourgeoisie, but
was driven out and forced to sign away her rights to see her two
daughters when her numerous affairs were discovered. Sticking
closely to the structure and the dialogue of the source novel,
Chabrol's film is fragmented, shifting backwards and forwards

31 Chabrol comments on the fact that Stephane Audran could almost have been
   Marie Trintignant's mother in real life, since Audran's first husband was
   Marie's father, Jean·Louis Trintignant (Jousse and Toubiana 199 2 : 34).
144   CLAUDE CHABROL


between the present and the past. There is however no sense of
deliberate formal patterning here - as there is, say, in A double tour
 (I959) or us Bonnes Femmes (I960). The flashbacks, which include
repeated glimpses ofBetty's signing away of her children, and - in
a flashback within a flashback - a Freudian 'primal scene' in
which she sees her uncle having sex with the maid, are all subjec-
tive and, so to speak, organic. They develop from Betty's present
situation and state of mind. In this regard they are closer to the
fluid temporality of stream of consciousness than to the usual role
of flashbacks in cinema - to explain the present by reference to the
past. The flashbacks are traditionally anchored by close-ups of
Betty's face, but they are motivated not by any narrative function
so much as by Betty's own inability to follow the thread of the
present conversation. Bored and drunk, she claims to be listening
to Laure, and in fact we often continue to hear Laure's voice
droning on in the background, as images from the past drift into
Betty's mind and onto the screen. Even when the central enigma
in the film is resolved - how and why has Betty got into the state
she's in at the start? - a second is posed regarding her relationship
with Laure and with the latter's boyfriend, Mario. It is no coinci-
dence that the film ends with a close-up on Betty's mysterious
smile, shot through the misty waters of an aquarium. Like the
HelE~nes of La Femme infidele, Le Boucher and Juste avant la nuit
(played of course by Stephane Audran), she remains obscure.
    The close-ups on Marie Trintignant's face throughout the film
- like the flashbacks - invert their conventional role in cinema.
Where flashbacks are meant to explain, here they complicate
matters. (For instance, does the scene between her uncle and the
maid really explain Betty's promiscuity? Or is it a red herring, or at
the most, simply one stage in the development of her sexuality?)
Where facial close-ups on an actress are usually associated with
sacred beauty or eroticism, here they reveal Betty as ravaged,
exhausted and drunk, seemingly mechanical in her indifference
to everything except ordering the next whisky. (The unsparing
photography is not limited to Trintignant: Stephane Audran
complained that the chief cameraman had ruined her appearance
throughout the film.) Like Violette, Betty is presented as fragmented,
                                                  STORIES OF WOMEN      145


irreducible to one single reading. She is always seen from the
outside (hence the opening credit sequence where we watch
through a window as she drinks in a bar), even if the flashbacks
are subjective. Again as in Violette Noziere, the camera pans back
from an apparently real image of the protagonist's face to reveal it
as a reflection in the mirror. This raises questions of how Betty's
identity is defined.
    The dual nature ofBetty's identity makes the film one ofChabrol's
most incisive comments on the position of women in a male-
dominated society. (A position which is - again - exacerbated by
social class: Betty is a lower-class woman in a male-dominated and
bourgeois-dominated society.) 'Betty' is the protagonist'S natural
self anti-social, alcoholic and fascinated by sex. 'Elisabeth' is her
artificial self: a culturally defined identity as bourgeois wife and
mother, socialised and subservient. Even more than the loss of her
two small daughters and her expulsion from the bourgeoisie, it is
the traumatic collision of these two identities which is dramatised
in the scene of the paper-signing - the narrative crux of the film,
to which we are returned again and again by Betty's remembering
of it. As the first flashback reveals, Betty originally signs the paper
'Betty', but this is spotted by her mother-in-law (the personifi-
cation of the grande bourgeoisie and a character who only ever
refers to Betty as Elisabeth). Corrected by the lawyer, Betty signs as
'Elisabeth Etamble', giving her maiden name, age, (lack of) pro-
fession and so on. That this is felt as some kind of betrayal of her
real self is evident from her account of the event. In her drunken
misery at the memory of what she has done, she sobs that she has
sold her children, and also that Tai marque "Elisabeth" au lieu de
"Betty", et puis j'ai pris un cheque')' It is not just her daughters
that Betty has sold, but her own identity. Viewed in this light, the
spiral of drinking and casual sex which follows the signing of the
paper is Betty's means of reasserting her identity, and an act of
defiance against the legalistic and reductive definition of her
recorded in the document. The first proof of this comes when she
signs to have her belongings transferred to Laure's hotel in
Versailles: in a reversal of the document scene, she begins to write
32 'I put "Elisabeth" instead of "Betty", and then I took the cheque'
146     ClAUDE CHABROL


'Elisabeth', but changes the 'E' to a 'B' and signs as 'Betty'. The
final proof - as we shall see shortly - is her betrayal of Laure and
her running off with Mario.
    If sex and alcohol characterise Betty's natural behaviour, then
marriage and motherhood characterise her culturally acquired
identity. Flashbacks to her bourgeois existence with Guy Etamble
and his insufferable mother reveal the extent to which she is
required to deny her true personality and to become - like Jasmine
in Une affaire de femmes - little more than a womb. Her role is to
provide children but she is also, paradoxically, denied the chance
to rear them - that is the nanny's job. As in La Muette (1965) and
La Rupture (1970), it is the coldness of the bourgeois family that
Chabrol satirises most violently. In a scene added to the original
novel, Chabrol contrasts the marginalisation of Betty's children by
the Etambles - they are brought in to say goodnight but not allowed
to spend even five minutes with their mother - with a television
gameshow watched by Madame Etamble, in which the contestant
warmly declares, Tembrasse toute me famille - ma femme, mes
enfants .. .'JJ Betty is also confronted with the bourgeoisie in the
slightly seedy form of Laure. There is a kind of doubling here, in
which Laure is an older version of Elisabeth (Betty's bourgeois
self). Like Debbie and Bertha in Lang's The Big Heat (1953), they
are 'sisters under the mink'. During the long sequences in Laure's
hotel room, the two women tell each other about their past - each
using exactly the same form of words to assure the other that they
really are listening when they are not. Like Betty, Laure has tried to
drown a previous existence as a bourgeois wife in an alcoholic
binge. But whereas Betty never felt that she belonged to bourgeois
society ('le ne pouvais pas etre comme eux'),J4 and precipitated her
own expulsion from it (she is discovered having sex with her lover
in the middle of the drawing-room), Laure was a willing partici-
pant: 'Mon univers, c'etait mon mari, ma maison'.l5 Laure regrets

33 'I send my love to all the family - my wife, my children .. : With typical malice,
   Chabrol has Madame Etamble suddenly fall asleep in front of the television, as if

her husband's death, her isolation from the bourgeoisie and her
new, rootless status. She is lost without a social role to fulfil (hence
perhaps her mothering of Betty). She therefore represents what
Betty risks becoming if the latter fails to reassert her true, anti-
social and anti-bourgeois identity. This identity is characterised by
her survival instinct and her sex drive, which allow her to
overcome the falsity of her bourgeois life and eventually Laure's
claustrophobic maternal attentions. Rather than the female
solidarity of Une affaire de ftmmes, the relationship between Betty
and Laure is reminiscent of the power struggles between Charles
and Paul in the Heiene cycle (with Mario the object of desire and
exchange). Betty wins, and Laure goes away to die. The final line of
the film, read by Chabrol, declares that 'Laure Lavancher en
definitive etait morte parce que Betty avait survecu. C'etait l'une
ou l'autre, et Betty avait gagne')6 But it is also Elisabeth - the
tamed, civilised and constrained bourgeois self, the subservient
wife and mother - who has died, allowing Betty's true self to
survive.
    If female sexuality is spectral in Violette Noziere and illicit in
Madame Bovary, in Betty it is unclean. Betty is portrayed as dirty
(in both senses) throughout the film: at school she has to write on
the blackboard 'Je suis une petite sale';l7 when she meets Guy for
the first time, she spills coffee all over his clean suit; later he tells
her 'C'est efface'l8 when she confesses to a promiscuous past. As
she herself says, 'J'ai passe ma vie a salir')9 This complies with the
conventional, patriarchal representation of sexually active women
(particularly those from the lower classes, like Betty) as unclean:
'the bodies of erotic women, especially proletarian ones, become
so much wet dirt' (Theweleit 1987: 421). But Betty's sexuality is
not condemned in the film so much as celebrated - as an affront
to prudish bourgeois manners and as a defining fact of her own
existence. (Chabrol himself is fond of metaphors - like 'getting

36 'Ultimately, Laure Lavancher had died because Betty had survived. It was one or
   the other, and Betty had won'
37 '[ am a filthy little girl'
38 'It's wiped clean'
39 'I dirty everything [ touch'
148    CLAUDE CHABROL


your hands dirty' - which link life with dirt.) The Etambles perceive
8etty as a sexual threat, and try to redefine her as a desexualised
wife and mother - the 'white woman'. But her sexuality cannot be
repressed. The white suit she wears on the day she signs the
document becomes crumpled and stained in the bars and hotel
rooms she visits later that night. In the final triumphant scene -
when she has escaped with Mario to his suggestively named
restaurant Le Trou4° - she wears black, with red lipstick. As the
credits roll, a final close-up on her face centres on the sexual
symbol of her bright red mouth. Where Emma Bovary's 'red
woman' fantasy of eloping with Rodolphe fails, Betty's elopement
with Mario succeeds. (The parallel is emphasised by the mise en
scene: both women wear black with red lipstick in the climactic
scenes.) Alternatively, like Laura in Juste avant la nuit (1971) -
another sexually voracious woman associated with dirt - Betty has
been expelled from the apparently spotless bourgeoisie, but where
Laura is killed (and her murder effaced), 8etty survives, resolutely
sexual and anti-social to the last.

Popular film genres seem to entail the punishment of the
sexualised woman: hence the fate of the femme fatale in film noir
(Julie in Les Innocents aux mains sales) and the bad mother in
melodrama (Marie in Une affaire de femmes). Chabrol, as we have
seen, is fully aware of this convention and fore grounds it through
exaggeration. His adaptation of Madame Bovary elaborates the
main theme - women punished for having desires - of the genre
pieces just mentioned. The case with Violette Noziere and Betty is
complicated, however, by the fact that these are not genre films
(they are only distantly related to the thriller). 80th avoid the brutal
closure of the others, and allow their eponymous heroines to
survive beyond the last frame. lfin Violette Noziere this survival is
at the price of a rehabilitation into the conventionally feminised
space of domesticity, in Betty the situation is reversed: Betty has to
leave her children behind along with the unreal upper-class world
of the Etambles family. If it thus seems impossible for the women
in these films to have their cake and eat it (to have a family and a
40 The Hole
                                                    STORIES OF WOMEN              149


sexualised, independent identity), this is largely because of the
determining influence of social class (bourgeois codes of morality
in Madame Bovary and Betty) and of patriarchy (the male jurors
cursed by Violette, the Vichy state which condemns Marie). (It
might also be noted that all four films end with the voice of a male
narrator: Chabrol in Violette Noziere; Chabrol again, reading
Simenon, in Betty; Marie's son Pierrot in Une affaire de femmes;
and Fran<;ois Perrier reading Flaubert in Madame Bovary.) None
the less, the spirit of dissatisfaction and rebellion incarnated at
least temporarily by Violette and Emma, and almost incessantly by
Marie and Betty, remains - to be given a further, defiantly Marxist,
twist in La Ceremonie (1995).

Master of Ceremonie



Chabrol's forty-ninth film, La Ceremonie (1995), can be considered
the pinnacle of his career so far. Described by Cahiers du cinema as
'le plus grand film du cinema fran~ais depuis longtemps" (Strauss
1995: 26), it finally confirmed his long, slow rehabilitation by the
intellectual strand of the French film press. In contrast with the
critical reception in France for much of Chabrol's work from the
1960s, the 1970S and even the early 1980s, he was now con-
sidered 'le plus moderne de tous les auteurs issus de la Nouvelle
Vague" (Jousse 1995: 35), and possibly the greatest French film-
maker ever) Although this reassessment involved a very brief
glance back at his earlier films, it was principally on the evidence
of La Ceremonie that Chabrol was adjudged to be a master at work.
    Based on a Ruth Rendell crime novel that Chabrol updated and
modified (adding in particular an emphasis on television which
was absent from the book), the film relates the gradual tensions
that surface in the power relations between a wealthy bourgeois
family, the Lelievres, and their new maid Sophie (Sandrine Bon-
naire). The two catalysts for the bloody finale, in which the family
are shot dead in cold blood, are Sophie's sense of powerlessness -
exacerbated and symbolised by her inability to read - and her

friendship with Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert), who encourages her to
rebel against her masters. The film thus functions both as a
thriller and, in a political sense, as an illustration of the class war
which Chabrol continues to observe in French society. But not
only is La Ceremonie a masterful film in its own right, it can also be
seen as a compendium of some of the motifs that characterise
Chabrol's work as a whole. It is in attending to these motifs that
we can come to a conclusion regarding Chabrol's long-disputed
status as an auteur in French cinema.



The fait divers

We have already seen how real-life crime stories or faits divers are
reflected in several of Chabrol's films, from Les Bonnes Femmes
and Les Noces rouges to Violette Noziere and Une affaire de femmes.
This is also true, to an extent, of La Ceremonie, which is partly
analogous to the infamous case of the Papin sisters. In I933, a year
before the equally notorious crime committed by Violette Noziere,
the Papins, both maids, butchered their mistress and her
daughter. The trial that followed drew a huge amount of attention
from the public and the media, and gave rise to two distinct inter-
pretations of the crime. As with Violette Noziere, the surrealists
interpreted the Papin case politically - as a direct attack on the
bourgeoisie by its very own servants. But according to psychia-
trists, the crime was psychological rather than political, and was in
a sense committed not by both sisters but by a bizarre and paranoid
'third person' who they became under stress (Walker I995: 94).
Although no direct reference is made to the Papin case in La
Ceremonie, it influenced Chabrol's co-writer Caroline Eliacheff in
her reworking of the source novel (Guerin and Jousse I995: 30).
The result is a certain emphasis on the fusion of identities
between Sophie and Jeanne as if, like the Papin sisters, they were
turning into a murderous third person. This process begins when
Sophie visits Jeanne's flat and they discover that they have a
similar past (Sophie was implicated in the death of her father,
Jeanne in the death of her daughter). Beyond this shared guilt
152    CLAUOE CHABROL


(even before the shared murder) there is a sense of shared identity
as the two sit watching Sophie's television, arm in arm, with their
hair in pigtails and vacant expressions on their faces. And the
process is completed in the murder sequence, during which their
gestures (whether drinking coffee in the kitchen as they reload or
bearing down on Gilles in the doorway of the drawing-room) are
identical and simultaneous. Much more so than Betty and Laure
(Betty) , or even Why and Frederique (Les Biches), Sophie and
Jeanne are at this point one and the same.
    But if La Cirimonie is in part a version of the Papin case, it does
not privilege the psychological reading over the political one, in
the way that Nancy Meckler's Sister My Sister (UK, 1994) does.
From the opening credits (showing two little girls combing each
other's hair) to the final shot (the two sisters clinging to each other
in bed, their hair wild and their faces haggard),4 Meckler's film
focuses on the psychotic and ultimately incestuous closeness
between the two maids. Chabrol, on the other hand, avoids any
sustained or direct psychological explanation for the murder of
the Lelievres. This allows him to maintain a sense of the opacity of
human motives and to introduce a possible political interpretation
of the killing. It is impossible to say whether Sophie and Jeanne
commit the murders in order to avenge personal humiliations
(Melinda discovering that Sophie cannot read, Monsieur Lelievre
accusing Jeanne of opening his mail), or to reverse power
relations between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.
   Above and beyond individual cases, the fait divers as a form can
be usefully compared to Chabrol's cinema in general. The fait
divers 'speaks of scandal, sensation, disruption of the norm', events
that 'the dominant ideology cannot accommodate ... properly'
(Walker 1995: 1-2). It is precisely such disruptions that interest
Chabrol, especially insofar as they challenge accepted morality,
which he calls 'Une regIe de jeu qui arrange une classe domin-
ante'S (Chabrol 1976: 53). In his films, the 'disruption of the norm'

4 This is a recreation of the famous photograph of the Papin sisters after the
  murder, published in 1933 in the magazines Ditective and Le Surrialisme au
  service de la revolution.
5 'The rules of a game that suits the dominant class'
                                       MASTER OF CEREMONIE           153


most often takes the form of an intrusion into the enclosed and
self-satisfied world of the bourgeoisie, and typically either begins
Uuste avant la nuit) or ends (L'(EU du malin, Les Biches, La Femme
infidele, La Cirimonie) with murder. What makes the latter case so
shocking is the extent to which the victims of the murder are
normalised. Unlike, say, the corrupt and buffoonish Paul in Les
Noces rouges, the claustrophobic and incestuous families in Blood
Relatives and Violette Noziere, or the Fascistic Vichy regime in Une
affaire de femmes, the Lelievre family are unobjectionable. Their
only fault is in fact simply their function - as Sophie's employers,
and as the embodiment of the bourgeoisie. They represent the
masters, the norm, the 'dominant ideology', and it is as such that
they are destroyed.
    The potentially subversive effects of the fait divers are usually
mitigated by its position, literally at the margins of journalism.
Thus the fait divers in fact works to neutralise threats against the
norm:
   the rubric of the fait divers has a dual function: on the one hand, by
   reporting odd or bizarre items, it seeks to translate them into the
   language of common concerns; but, because of its secondary
   status. it marginalizes such items, keeps them at a safe remove
   from the centre of society. The fait-diversier thus lays claim to the
   off-beat or grotesque on behalf of bourgeois humanism or
   conventional society. (Walker 1995: 2)
    Chabrol's cinema carries out the first function but not the
second. It translates the violent, the inexplicable and the grotesque
- be it revolution (Les Biches) , terrorism (Nada), freak accidents
(Les Cousins, La Muette, Que la bete meure) murder (numerous
films from A double tour to La Cirimonie) or suicide (Le Cri du
hibou, Dr M, Madame Bovary) - into 'the language of common
concerns' by filming these events in the guise of popular genres,
notably the thriller. But because genre cinema is at the centre and
not at the margins, Chabrol's work does not marginalise its
narratives in the way that the fait divers, or indeed art cinema,
does. At least after his new-wave period, Chabrol deliberately uses
recognisable genres and classical realism in order to aim his work
at 'the centre of society'. (So successful was he in this respect that
154     CLAUDE CHABROL


 during the late 1960s and early 1970S he was equated with 'the
centre' by radical film critics.) This approach allows him to
undermine rather than defend 'bourgeois humanism'. It should
also be noted that Chabrol works largely in realist film genres (the
thriller, the melodrama, the war film, the period drama). Only one
of his films can be classified as fantasy cinema (Alice ou la demiere
fugue), and while the vampire movie informs part of Les Biches, he
has never made a horror film or a science fiction film. (This
contrasts with his new-wave colleagues, Godard and Truffaut,
who made Alphaville and Fahrenheit 451 respectively.) The reason
for this may be the marginal status traditionally accorded to
fantasy genres in France. By sticking to the thriller and other realist
genres, Chabrol has managed to maintain a subversive position
within the mainstream.



Class war
Politically as well as aesthetically, Chabrol is interested in
bringing the margins to the centre. In the late 1970S he predicted
that 'the real center will be a sort of modern Marxism' (Yakir 1979:
9). Even if by the early 1990S events seemed to have proved him
wrong - with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of
communism - he was still prepared to make what he half-jokingly
called 'le dernier film marxiste'6 (Guerin and Taboulay 199T 68).
La Ceremonie fulfils this function by virtue of the importance of
class struggle within the film.7 Hence the destruction of the
bourgeois Lelievre family by the working·class pairing of Sophie
and Jeanne. In this respect, the generally blameless behaviour of
the Lelievres is crucial. Their best efforts to treat Sophie correctly
are doomed to failure because they fail to accept her as she is
(unable to read) and they also fail, politically speaking, to frame

 6 'the last Marxist film'
 7 To a certain degree, the film also reflects concerns about current tensions in
   French society. Chabrol has said that La Cirimonie predicts an imminent implo-
   sion while Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine (also 1995) predicts an imminent
   explosion. See Berthomieu et al. 1995: 9.
                                            MASTER OF CEREMONIE              155


their efforts in any other form than that of master-servant
relations. Thus Melinda, who tries hardest to be fair to Sophie, cannot
help ordering her about even when they are supposed to be having
a cup of tea together. (She also offends Jeanne with her superior
knowledge and her superior manner.) The family are therefore
killed not because of their personalities (which are sympathetic),
but because of their class. As Chabrol says, '[la famille bourgeoise)
n'est attaquable que par son etat, c'est s;a le marxisme'8 (Guerin
and Jousse 1995: 28). Sophie is not in the slightest ideologically
aware, while Jeanne's resentment confuses the political with the
personal, but that does not prevent their actions -like those of the
Papin sisters - from being represented or interpreted as class war.
    In contrast with the bourgeois families of La Muette, Les Noces
rouges and Folies bourgeoises, the Lelievres are not subjected to
ridicule by means of farce. Nor are they subjected to the half-ideal-
ised, half-satirical perspective of the Helene cycle. Consequently
La Cirimonie is Chabrol's most direct representation of class
struggle. This is a matter of setting as well as characterisation.
Where Les Biches concerns personal relations as a metaphor for
revolution, La Rupture depicts a class-based custody battle and
Nada a political kidnapping, La Cirimonie alone concerns social
relations in the workplace. 9 That the workplace happens to be the
Lelievres' family home only serves to emphasise the gulf between
the bourgeoisie and the working-classes. For while the Lelievres
epitomise the bourgeois family, Sophie and Jeanne - both solitary,
both associated with the death of a family member - reflect what
Marx calls 'the practical absence of the family among the prole-
tarians' (Marx and Engels [1848) (1953): 74). La Cirimonie thus
makes explicit what is implicit in Chabrol's work as a whole - the
absence of the working-class family.
    In the bourgeois home, Sophie is taught to know her place. Her
servile function is equated with certain actions and also certain
spaces within the house: her tiny bedroom (the chambre de bonne

  relations.

or maid's room), the back stairs, the kitchen (described to her by
Madame Lelievre as 'votre domaine').'o By fitting into these spaces,
and entering others only with the authorisation of her employers,
Sophie literally learns to serve. Her friendship with Jeanne entails
a refusal to serve ne vais pas leur obeir')" and consequently a
change of place. It is only when Jeanne visits the house that
Sophie is finally seen using the main staircase rather than the
back stairs. Her freedom of movement in the house symbolises
her growing insubordination; it is immediately after a shot of
Sophie openly going up the main stairs on her own that Monsieur
Lelievre fires her. Tellingly, when the murders take place, they are
presented as a parody of servile duties. Sophie and Jeanne climb
the main stairs to the master bedroom as if they were (still) maids:
Jeanne carries a tray of hot chocolate and Sophie is wearing her
apron. They proceed to tear up Madame Lelievre's dresses in a
frenzied parody of the scenes where they (and other working-class
volunteers) sorted the old clothes donated to the 'Secours
catholique'. Monsieur Lelievre is actually shot dead in Sophie's
domain, the kitchen, before the finale in which the servants finally
enter the bourgeois inner sanctum - the drawing-room - to kill the
rest of their masters.



Femmes jatales
But the power struggle in La Ceremonie is not simply a matter of
the working classes versus the bourgeoisie. Nor is it really a
question of gender, since Madame Lelievre's good looks and
leisurely lifestyle are just as much the target of Jeanne's anger as
Monsieur Lelievre's self-righteousness and autocratic air. As with
the Charles-Paul conflicts in Les Cousins and the Helene cycle, or
the shifting relations between Why and Frederique in Les Biches
and between Betty and Laure in Betty, here also there is a personal
battle. Sophie and Jeanne are, to a great extent, identified with
each other, both through the narrative (their secret pasts, their

 common enemy) and the mise en scene (their similar appearance
 and gestures in the later stages of the film). But they are also
 implicitly pitted against each other. At first Sophie is dominated
 by Jeanne (who can read whereas Sophie cannot, who talks while
 Sophie is silent). She even assumes her servile role as the maid in
 Jeanne's flat: she is the one who prepares and serves the coffee.
 But ultimately Sophie takes control: she initiates the murders,
 first shooting Monsieur Lelievre and then leading the way into the
 drawing-room to kill the others. The case is much the same as in
 Betty or Les Biches: only the stronger of the two women will
 survive. The reason for this is the dual status of Chabrol's female
 protagonists. As he explains with regard to Betty, women in his
 films are at once victims (of a patriarchal society) and also fighters:
 'Notre univers est masculinise, machiste. Par rapport a cet
 univers, une femme a tous les droits'" (Berthomieu et al. 1995:
 13). Ambivalence also characterises Chabrol's male characters, for
 example the noble avenger-cowardly liar Charles in Que la bete
 meure or the white knight-greedy manipulator Wolf in Masques
 (their duplicity is suggested by the fact that both act under
 assumed names). But the duality of the women in Chabrol's films
 is more generalised, because it is a product of society as he sees it.
 lt is reflected in the heterosexual couple by the Helenes of Le
 Boucher (at once Popaul's potential victim and the person indirectly
 responsible for his death) and Juste avant la nuit (the under-
 standing wife who coolly prepares her husband's suicide). But it
 also manifests itself within female friendships, including that
between Sophie and Jeanne in La Ceremonie.
     Duality (or, in a more stigmatised form, duplicity) is also a
defining characteristic of the femme fatale archetype from film noir.
Although La Ceremonie cannot be defined as afilm noir, Sophie is
in certain ways characterised as a dangerous femme fatale (whereas
 Jeanne is not). The first hint comes when she is introduced to her
duties by Madame Lelievre. The introduction of the femme fatale in
film noir traditionally involves a shot of her descending a staircase,
with the focus on her legs - as in Double Indeminity (1944), The
12   'Our society is male·dominated and chauvinist. In such a world. a woman has to
     use whatever she can'
158    CLAUDE CHABROL


 Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), or Truffaut's La Femme d'"
 cote (1981). The image ofthefommefatale is also usually dark and
 ominous: 'Film noir lighting suggests duplicity: an unknown threat
which might emerge from the shadows' (Cook 1980: 78) Both of
 these elements (the composition and the lighting) are echoed in
 Sophie's first appearance in her role as the Lelievres' maid.
 Chabrol shoots her from below, as she descends the dingy back
 stairs into the kitchen. Framing (the focus is on her legs), costume
 (she has put on a dark dress) and lighting (she emerges from
 shadows) all comply with film noir conventions, and encode
 Sop hie as a femme fatale. The effect is also to invert the optimistic
implications of the previous scene, in which Sophie watches the
beginning of a television drama showing a female lawyer ascend-
ing the white stone steps to a courthouse in daylight. This safe
image - of a socially acceptable form of female ambition - is
replaced by its opposite: the fomme fatale who will take an anti-
social form of power - the "'unnatural" phallic power' of the gun
 (Place 1980: 45) - into her own hands.
    After the murders, Sophie is again presented as a fomme fatale
 (again, in a way that Jeanne is not). But in this case, the conven-
tions of the film noir are evoked only to be transcended. Tradition-
ally, the fomme fatale is punished at the end of a film noir. She is
either literally (via the narrative) or figuratively (via the mise en
scene) imprisoned, defeated or killed. (Jeanne's death in the car
crash is not encoded as the punishment of a fomme fatale but as an
ironic coincidence: it is her bete noire the priest who accidentally
kills her). Whereas Julie's fate in us Innocents aux mains sales
exaggeratedly, almost parodically, adheres to this convention,
there is no such punishment for Sophie at the end of La Ceremonie.
Although she is represented as a femme fatale in the final scene (by
the expressionist lighting, the shadows, her pale face looming out
of the night) she escapes closure. Whereas Julie is incarcerated
alone in her villa and condemned to grieve in a night illuminated
only by the hallucinatory image of the mysterious flashing light
(as if her husband were calling to her from the grave), Sophie
literally escapes from the frame, walking away from the house, the
crime scene, and the flashing lights of the police. Like Betty, she
                                              MASTER OF CEREMONIE            159


 survives. But unlike Betty, and unlike the conventional femme
fatale, Sophie also escapes from the controlling commentary of
 the male voice-over. Like most films noirs, many of Chabrol' s films
 about women - Betty, Madame Bovary, Une affaire de femmes,
 Violette Noziere and even implicitly Les Innocents aux mains sales (if
 one accepts that the light symbolises Louis calling to Julie) - end
 with a male voice. '3 It is as if these women are being controlled by
 a male narrator (as indeed, they are - by Simenon, Flaubert and
 Chabrol himself). La Ciremonie however, was largely authored by
women (Ruth Rendell wrote the novel, Caroline Eliacheff co-wrote
the screenplay), and, as the police play back the tape-recording of
the murder, it ends with the female voices of Sophie and Jeanne.
Although there is a typical Chabrolian ambivalence here - Sophie
has been seen to escape, but she has implicated herself, and could
yet be caught - the fact remains that the murderer, the femme
fatale, has gone unpunished. Her spectral appearance as she drifts
into the night recalls Violette's first appearance in Violette Noziere.
 But, as Chabrol's own voice tells us, Violette was rehabilitated as a
safe woman (the opposite of the femme fatale) through her im-
prisonment. Sophie has escaped the imprisonment, the rehabili-
tation and the male voice.



The expressionist house
The representation of Sophie, Violette and Julie as variations on
the femme fatale is partly dependent on Chabrol's use of the
expressionist mise en scene associated with film noir. Chabrol's
expressionism also owes a particular debt to Fritz Lang, who used
it not only in his films noirs but also in westerns and fantasy films.
If Hitchcock's influence on Chabrol is most evident in terms of
voyeurism and point of view (see below, p. 107), Lang's legacy is
clearest in terms of decor. Although the shadowy lighting and
unsettling camera angles prevalent in expressionism are used
sparingly in Chabrol's films, the symbolic significance of
expressionist decor is a constant. Houses and apartments almost

160     CLAUDE CHABROL


always express their occupants' state of mind or destiny. In Les
 Cousins, the weapons on the walls of Paul's apartment suggest his
predatory strength while Charles's bedroom isolates him from the
open living-space. The glass houses of Leda in A double tour and
the Massons in Juste avant la nuit appear to be open and trans-
parent, but in fact they hide secrets, and the lives lived within will
prove vulnerable. Helene's tower room in Le Boucher symbolises
her flight from the world, while the blue room HelEme rents in La
 Rupture evokes the threatening presence of Regnier and his plot to
ensnare her. In Violette Noziere, Blood Relatives and Madame Bovary
the walls close in like the moral constraints of the bourgeois
family.
    Much like the Gothic houses in Ten Days' Wonder and Masques,
the house in La Ceremonie is large and isolated. These houses
function as enclosed worlds, ruled by the patriarchal Theo van
Horn and Legagneur, or the more paternalistic Lelievres. But their
Gothic appearance also creates a sense of foreboding, evoked in
the opening shot of each of the houses in question, and heigh-
tened in the climactic nocturnal sequences from all three films. In
La Ceremonie, moreover, great emphasis is placed on the house's
isolation. Madame Lelievre tells Sophie twice in their first inter-
view that it is 'une maison isolee','4 while the situation of the
house itself is doubled by Sophie's room within it (alone. at the
top) and the site of the nearest town (Saint Malo. cut off and
enclosed by its famous walls). The effect is to evoke Sophie's own
isolation. not just as a stranger and a servant in the household. but
also as an illiterate. and hence someone who is not fully socialised
but remains cut off from the world around her. When confronted
with its demands - in the form of the written note from Madame
Lelievre or the telephone call from Monsieur Lelievre - she retreats.
like Helene in Le Boucher, and locks herself up in her room.
    We have already noted the political symbolism of the division
of space within the Lelievres' home. The domain of the masters is
clearly demarcated as the main staircase, the drawing-room, the
dining-room and (naturally) the master bedroom. Sophie. as the
servant, is associated with the back stairs and the rooms they link
14 'an isolated house'
                                      MASTER OF CEREMONIE         161


- the kitchen and the chambre de bonne. The principal sites of
communication or passage between the two spaces are the main
staircase and the oval mirror in the hall. Both belong to the realm
of the masters, but they allow access to the world 'below stairs': the
staircase because it offers an alternative route to the kitchen and to
Sophie's room, the mirror because it reflects the doorway into the
kitchen, Sophie's domain. It is only when she has learned to use
the main stairs for her own purposes, and to infiltrate the master
bedroom, that Sophie masters the house with her gaze. The hall
mirror, meanwhile, shows Madame Lelievre entering the other
world of the kitchen to look for Sophie, but it also shows Sophie's
gradual assumption of power within the house. (The possibility of
a such a metamorphosis is glimpsed when Sophie watches on
television a programme in which a young woman stares into a
mirror before accepting a potion from a mysterious magician: it is
as if she were accepting an invitation to go through the looking-
glass.) If the first close-up on Sophie's face in the hall mirror
suggests impotence (she appears to be reading a note, but cannot
in fact read), the next suggests power (as she listens to Melinda's
phone conversation and learns of her secret pregnancy). As well as
being fundamental in the construction of space as power in La
Ceremonie, the staircase and the mirror are also key motifs from
expressionism. In the expressionist mise en scene offilm noir, both
motifs are associated with the femme fatale: the staircase to
symbolise her dominance over the male characters, the mirror to
suggest her narcissism and duality. More generally, in film noir as
in Chabrol's work as a whole, mirrored compositions imply that
'nothing and no-one is what it seems' (Place 1980: 48).



Looking as power
The organisation of space is the key means by which Chabrol
expresses power relations in his work. Stairs or split levels allow
one character to dominate another, to look down at their victim.
This motif is first seen in Les Cousins, when Paul, on top of a
ladder, looks down at Charles's arrival (the telescope he uses even
162    CLAUDE CHABROL


 suggests the gun with which he will later kill Charles). It is also
crucial to Les Innocents aux mains sales, where Louis's power over
his wife is equated with his position at the top of the stairs while
she is beneath him. And in Dr M, the citizens of Berlin are
controlled by the images on the walls above them. Power is also
associated with the outsider looking in. Both L'(Ei! du malin and Le
 Cri du hibou detail what happens when the voyeur abandons his
controlling position and goes inside. Spatial relations are just as
expressive of power in La Ceremonie. In certain key sequences, the
dominant character organises the space around them and impli-
citly controls the others in the frame. This is evident in the very
first scene, where Madame Lelievre meets Sophie in the cafe. The
point of view here - and hence the power - is Madame Lelievre's.
She is the controlling presence, sitting and observing as Sophie
searches for the right cafe and then the right table. (In retrospect,
this opening scene can also be judged to hint at Sophie's
particular form of powerlessness, her inability to read: hence her
confusion as to which cafe is the right one, her ignorance as to
what day of the week it is, and so on.) But in their next meeting, at
the train station, the power relations are subtly reversed. This
time, although again the scene is largely experienced from
Madame Lelievre's perspective, she is the one at a disadvantage.
While she waits for Sophie to get off the train, the latter has in fact
already arrived. It is the employer and not the maid who is now
struggling to find the right place. Eventually Sophie is revealed on
a different platform, silent and ominous, and watching Madame
Lelievre. Even though we are never given Sophie's point of view in
this sequence, the implication remains that in this instance, she is
the one in control. (This is ironic since the explanation for her
early arrival on the wrong train and the wrong platform is that she
cannot read the timetable.)
    Sophie's powerlessness is explained and symbolised not just by
her servile role, but also by her iIliteracy. She is thus doubly at a
disadvantage in relation to her employers. When she desperately
tries to decode Madame Lelievre's note by means of her reading
manual, she is equated with a powerless child in an adult world:
all the photos in the book are of children. The importance of
                                     MASTER OF CEREMONIE        163


reading and not being able to read in La Ceremonie is a variation on
the theme oflooking as power which informs many of Chabrol's
films, and which is derived from Hitchock's exploration of voyeur-
ism in Rear Window (1954) and Vertigo (1958). In L'<Eit du malin,
 Le Cri du hibou and L'Enfor, the voyeur either deliberately or
unconsciously destroys the object of his gaze. Masques and Dr M
focus on the omnipotent and omnipresent, quasi-divine gaze of
the patriarch (Legagneur and Marsfeldt), and contrast it with the
blindness of their victims (Catherine, the citizens of Berlin). Both
films also express power relations in terms of watching television,
which entails an active, powerful look (the gaze of the screen) and
a passive, impotent look (the gaze at the screen). La Ceremonie
revisits the metaphor of television spectatorship as powerlessness.
Sophie's passivity and isolation is underlined by her habit of
watching TV endlessly in her room. Even when Jeanne accom-
panies her, the television acts as a neutralising force and positions
them as vacant and passive. Whereas the Papin sisters were said to
have fused into a third person capable of butchery, Sophie and
Jeanne appear to have fused into a third person capable of little
more than staring at the small screen. When they cease watching
TV, therefore, and actually look down on the Lelievre family sat on
the couch watching Mozart's Don Giovanni, the change from passive
spectatorship to active looking is felt as a crucial assumption of
power.
   The voyeuristic sequence which precedes the murder is the
turning-point of the film. It presents Sophie and Jeanne as
powerful - and the Lelievres as vulnerable - by means of the
spatial relationship between the two, and specifically though a
combination of the Langian metaphor of the staircase and the
Hitchcockian metaphor of the gaze. Stairs, as we have seen, are
the site of power for the femme fatale in film noir and for certain
characters in Chabrol's work. They are associated in La Ceremonie
not just with the master-servant relationship (main staircase and
back stairs), but also with the power of the priest over his
parishioners: hence the two scenes in which the priest exercises
his authority from the stairs in the church hall, first to reprimand
the choirboys for arriving late, and then to dismiss Jeanne and
164   CLAUDE CHABROL


Sophie from the 'Secours catholique'. The murders in La Ceremonie
do not take place on the stairs (as they did in the Papin case and in
the British film version, Sister My Sister), but they are precipitated
and predicted by Sophie and Jeanne's dominant position once
they have climbed the main staircase to the master bedroom.
From here, they can master the Lelievres with their gaze, looking
down on them from the gallery above the drawing-room. As with
the disconcerting sequence at the train station, here again the
camera shifts from master/s to servant/s, thereby revealing who is
really in control. Chabrol pans slowly upwards from the couch
where the family sit watching television to show Sophie and
Jeanne silently observing from the gallery. Twice, we are given the
servants' point of view as they look down on their masters.
Pacified and immobilised by their attention to the TV screen, the
Lelievres are excruciatingly vulnerable. (The sound of the opera,
besides, will mask the first gunshots and so limit their chances of
escape.) Within a matter of minutes, the family will be lying dead
on the couch.



Ambivalence
Like Chabrol's cinema in general, La Ceremonie explores shifting
relations between characters, and presents sudden reversals of
power. Even in the final frame - in this case, Sophie's escape from
the crime scene - there is rarely a sense of resolution or closure.
This adds to the sense that Chabrol's work is essentially a cinema
of ambivalence. His films are funny in both senses: often un-
expectedly comic, they are also strange, unsettling and disturbing.
Their ambivalence is most evident in the fluctuating tone, the
open endings, and the lack of moral judgement that these endings
imply. Very few of Chabrol's films are totally consistent in tone.
Where farce dominates, there are also moments of poignancy, as
in the endings of Les Noces rouges and Folies bourgeoises. Even the
darkest and most serious of his films is punctuated by black
humour: the Fascist newsreels of L'am de Vichy are edited
together with a sly and devastating irony, so that the propagandist
                                     MASTER Of CEREMONIE        165


intentions of the original soundtrack are undermined by the
resonance of the images (shots of charcoal burners and holiday
trains evoking the Holocaust, for example). The most frequent
disruptions of tone in Chabrol's work are not however in the
editing, but in the acting.
    Sudden eruptions of comic clowning or of theatrical overacting
often break through the classic realism of the mise en scene and at
times even question the realist illusion (that we are watching
actual rather than staged events). The neorealist bleakness of Les
Bonnes Femmes is qualified by the exaggerated hamming of Pierre
Bertin as the store-owner, in a grotesque parody of the romantic
hero that Jacqueline dreams of. Slightly less out of place in La
Rupture - because it is a melodrama - but equally comic are the
gestures and delivery ofMario David as the unemployed thespian
who enlivens the Pinellis' guest-house. In Que la hete meure, the
realism of the narrative is suddenly and self-consciously disturbed
by the appearance ofJean-Louis Maury as a peasant, appearing out
of nowhere to give Charles the clues he needs to track down Paul
Decourt. Rather than disguise the plotting here, Chabrol simply
exaggerates it, with the huge 'detour' signs and the mysterious
peasant foregrounding the role of coincidence. Such is the peasant's
self-referential status (and such is his physical appearance) that
some commentators have erroneously suggested that he is played
by Chabrol himself. Chabrol does pull off a comic turn as the
philandering bourgeois father in La Muette, but usually he relies
on the comic duo of Henri Attal and Dominique Zardi to provide
the light relief in numerous films, including Les Biches (the
pretentious and irritating intellectuals Robegue and Riais) , La
Femme infidele (a client in a cafe and the motorist who crashes into
Charles's car), Juste avant la nuit (the investigating detective and
Charles's foppish advertising partner) and even Madame Bovary
(the bailiff and the blind man, the latter another personification of
fate in Chabrol's work and a reprise ofZardi's role as the balloon-
seller in La Rupture). Similarly, Fran~ois Maistre appears in
several comic roles - as one of the detectives in Ies Innocents aux
mains sales, the euphemistic judge in Une affaire de femmes, and
the speech-giver in the 'Cornices' scene from Madame Bovary. (Ies
166     CLAUDE CHABROL


 Innocents aux mains sales is one of the most sustained examples of
ambivalent tone in Chabrol's cinema, presenting as it does the
struggle of a femme fatale to maintain her dignity while being
tormented by two detectives and a fast-talking lawyer; one could
say that the film thereby enacts a struggle between genres - the
film noir versus the comedy thriller.) It is to this strand of clowns
and buffoons - often blissfully unaware of the gravity of the narra-
tive in which they find themselves - that the unctuous priest in La
 Ceremonie belongs. Here, the effect is simply comic rather than
self-referential: Jean-Fran~ois Perrier is always rolling his eyes
and wringing his hands, whether he is scolding Jeanne and
Sophie at the church hall, or explaining to the police how he
managed to kill the former in a car crash.
    The ending of La Ceremonie is ambivalent in that it asks
questions which can be answered one of two ways. Firstly, and
most obviously, will Sophie be caught by the police? Secondly,
there is the moral question of how the spectator interprets the
killing of the Lelievres. Chabrol carefully times the playback of the
incriminating tape so that the final credits finish with Jeanne's
remark to Sophie: 'On a bien fait?'.'5 Moreover, on the playback
the question is addressed directly to the audience rather than to
Sophie. Thus La Ceremonie ends with a question mark, as do so
many of Chabrol's films, including Le Beau Serge (has Fran~ois
sacrificed himself?) , Les Biches (is Paul next?), La Femme infidele (is
this ending happy or sad?), Que la bete meure (will Charles survive?)
and L'Enftr (is Nelly alive or dead?). But here the question is voiced
rather than just implied. As a result, the difficulty of making a
moral judgement is rendered explicit here, while it is implicit
elsewhere (at the end of L'(Ei! du malin, Que la bite meure, Le
Boucher and others). La Ceremonie dramatises the choice that the
individual spectator is faced with at the end of most of Chabrol's
films. The depiction of the victims and the perpetrators has been
deliberately even-handed even if, as in Nada, one senses the
director's political preference. Whatever one's final judgement,
the posing of the moral dilemma illustrates Chabrol's belief that
15 'Did we do right?'. Although one could interpret this as a statement of fact ('We
   did right'), Huppert's intonation suggests that it is more of a question.
                                              MASTER OF cEREMONIE               167


'11 n'est pas d'ames toutes noires, ni toutes blanches'I6 (Chabrol
1976: 53). It also demonstrates a lack of closure - the key deviation
in his work from the conventions of genre cinema, and the major
link with art cinema.



Is Chabrol an auteur?
Although ambivalence and lack of closure are characteristic of art
cinema (see Bordwell 1979), they do not in themselves identify
Chabrol as an auteur. Nor is the fact that we have been able to
isolate recurrent motifs in numerous films - of different genres
and over a period of forty years - totally conclusive. There is how-
ever a certain consistency of theme, style and form throughout
much of his career. Most convincingly, Chabrol's statements in
his autobiography and in numerous interviews (again over many
years) confirm the impression of a personal vision running
through his work: 'Ce que je cherche c'est que l'ensemble de mes
realisations donne une idee tres precise d'une vision des choses'I7
(Chabrol 1976: 347). Chabrol, at least, seems persuaded that he is
an auteur. And in La Ceremonie, as well as reprising several
favourite concerns, he even indulges in a classic auteurist gesture,
when the Lelievres watch Les Noces rouges on television. Whatever
the practical explanation - Chabrol claims that he wanted a
suggestive scene, and that it was simply cheaper to show one from
his own film than from someone else's (Berthomieu et al. 1995:
11) - this functions as a self-referential aside. Like Truffaut - who
includes clips from his earlier films in L'Amour en foite (1979) -
Chabrol refers not just to idols like Hitchcock, but increasingly to
his own filmography. This is evident not just in La Ceremonie, but
also in Poulet au vinaigre, which takes its ending directly from
Folies bourgeoises.
    The status of auteur was in a sense officially conferred on
Chabrol by Cahiers du cinema in October 1997, when they devoted

16 'No soul is completely evil. nor completely good'
17 'What I'm after is that my films as a whole give a very precise idea of a personal
   vision'
168     ClAUDE CHABROl


a special issue to his career. But this came rather late in the day,
after notable resistance to the idea in the 1960s and 1970s. The
stumbling-block seems to have been his reliance on popular
genres, and this - along with his emphasis on the collective nature
of film-making - remains an important qualification of the
categorisation of Chabrol as an auteur. None the less, as the critics
on Cahiers du cinema argued in the 1950S (Chabrol among them),
a director working within the constraints of genre cinema can still
be an auteur. witness Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang, Howard
Hawks or Nicholas Ray. It has simply taken the French film press
a very long time to realise that this argument applies to Chabrol
too. Finally, it should be stressed that a Chabrol film from the late
1950S is not the same as one from the early 1990s. In particular,
Chabrol's balancing of commercial constraints with formal
experimentation underwent a major shift during the 1960s. It is
not unreasonable to see at least three distinct periods in his career:
the experimentation of the new wave, the purely commercial years
that followed, and the relative freedom of the three decades since
Les Biches in 1967. (One might also choose to distinguish between
the periods before and after Marin Karmitz became Chabrol's
regular producer in 1985.) Only after Les Biches has Chabrol been
able to make the films he wants to in more or less the way that he
wants to. This has entailed (as a deliberate choice rather than an
enforced necessity) the exploration of auteurist concerns within
popular genres. After swinging in the 1960s from one extreme to
the other, over the last thirty years Chabrol has managed to unite
auteurism and genre cinema in a successful hybrid which stands
as a landmark in French film.

Afterword



By virtue of being Chabrol's fiftieth film, Rien ne va plus is an
important auteurist landmark. (Very few directors, at least in the
modem era, have made fifty films.) The rapturous critical recep-
tion for La Ceremonie in 1995 was followed by a series of events
centred around the release of Rien ne va plus in autumn 1997,
including the publication of a special issue of Cahiers du cinema
and retrospectives of Chabrol's films at the Institut Lumiere in
Lyons, the Champo cinema in Paris, the French film festival in
Florence and the international film festival in Thessalonika. But
in the midst of these homages to Chabrol as an auteur the fact
remains that, in a typically contrary and humorous gesture, his
fiftieth film is - at least ostensibly - one of the least serious and
most enjoyably generic movies of his career.
    Rien ne va plus does include self-conscious, auteurist references
to Chabrol's earlier films, such as Juste avant la nuit (the wintry
setting, the shot of the oval mirror, the stained handkerchief), Les
Noces rouges (the handcuffing together of the two protagonists)
and Betty (the reconciliation at the end to the strains of Michel
Jonasz). But it places itself above all in the genre of the comic spy/
caper movie, exemplified by the James Bond series (begun in
1962) and by Chabrol's own work between 1964 and 1967 (in part
a French response to Bond). The film concerns the relationship
between two crooks, Betty (Isabelle Huppert) and Victor (Michel
Serrault), as they engage in a number of confidence tricks.
Tempted to step out of their league in order to steal five million
                                                  AFTERWORD      171


Swiss francs, they end up facing the larger-than-life Monsieur K
 (Jean-Fran~ois Balmer). In common with the Bond series and
Chabrol's mid-196os work such as the two Tigres and La Route de
 Corinthe, Rim ne va plus features exotic locations (St Moritz and
Guadeloupe), elaborate scenes of pursuit and interrogation, out-
landish thugs and an eccentric crime lord. like the archetypal
Bond fIlm, it begins in a casino and ends in a remote, romantic
hide-away. Above all, the film refers back to Chabrol's 1965 spy
spoof, Marie-Chantal contre Docteur Kha. Hence the sequences in
the Swiss hotel and on the Alpine ski-lifts, the use of trains and
planes, the cosmopolitan cast of minor characters (spies in Marie-
Chantal, hotel guests in Rim ne va plus), the comedy cameos
(Chabrol as a barman in the former, his son Thomas as a bell-boy
in the latter) and the sinister villains (Docteur Kha and his
namesake Monsieur K).'
    The playful balance between obvious generic stereotypes and
less obvious auteurist references is paralleled by the role oflies and
truth in the fIlm. Various interviews and reviews have quoted
Chabrol's assertion that Rien ne va plus is his first autobiographical
fIlm. This view would appear to neglect Le Beau Serge and Les
Cousins, as well as the roles played by Michel Bouquet in La Femme
infidele and Juste avant la nuit. But it is given some credence by the
fact that Rien ne va plus is Chabrol's first original screenplay since
Masques (co-written with Odile Barski in 1986), and his first solo
original screenplay since Alice ou la derniere fUgue in 1977. The
film may be peopled by generic stereotypes and affectionate
parodies, but somewhere among the games, the deceptions, the
simulations and reflections which recur throughout (Betty and
Victor's multiple identities, the two attache cases, the false ending
and the real one, even the Alpine landscapes perfectly reflected in
mountain lakes), there is perhaps an autobiographical truth. If
this truth is to be found anywhere, it is in the mysterious
relationship between Victor and Betty. Are they lovers? Father and
daughter (she sometimes calls him 'Papa')? Or are they director
and star, the former a representation of Chabrol and the latter a

tribute to IsabeUe Huppert (and, more generally, to the impor-
tance of actresses in his recent work)?
    Betty is crucial to the mise en scene of Victor's projects: she is his
leading actress. Moreover, she indulges in a Chabrolian love of
masks and mysteries. like Chabrol, Victor is a professional, a cratfs-
man, who steers away from grandiose projects and prides himself
on his pragmatism. He enjoys the good life and believes not so
much that intelligence brings happiness, but that happiness
brings intelligence - as he tells Betty. Working together, the two
target middle-class victims (conferences of salesman or dentists),
initially entertaining them so that they don't realise they've been
conned until later (a possible metaphor for the subersive after-
effects of Chabrol's cinema). But it is not just Victor and Betty who
can be seen as alter egos for the director. Monsieur K also fulfils
that function, elaborately staging the interrogation and putting it
to music. Where Chabrol timed the murders in La Ceremonie to fit
the cadences of Mozart's Don Giovanni, so Monsieur K matches
his questioning ofBetty and Victor to the finale ofPuccini's Tosca.
Twice he asks for the last scenes of the opera to be played, and
twice the music rises to a crescendo just as the action reaches a
climax (first when Betty discovers Maurice dead in the bath, and
again when she guesses the combination for the attache case).
Even the anti-imperialist commentary heard on the plane and the
declaration on a TV show watched by Victor that truth is stranger
than fiction seem to voice Chabrol's own preoccupations.
    If Rien ne va plus is a personal manifesto, however, it is so not
just in its evident affection for genre cinema and its hints at auto-
biographical revelations. It is most memorable and most defiant
(given the rather worthy circumstances of the film's release) in its
sudden changes of tone and its celebration of bad taste. Hence the
characterisation of Monsieur K as a hybrid figure of parody,
menace and black humour. His account of the gruesome torture
and murder of Maurice is punctuated with macabre jokes:
Maurice was apparently 'intarissable',' and told K everything he
knew, not only about himself, but also about the lives of his

 2   'he wouldn't shut up'
                                                        AFTERWORD   173


parents, his sisters, his nephews. The villa sequence involving
Monsieur K also features kitsch decor (black-and-white animal-
skin chairs) and elements offarce. When K breaks Victor's finger,
the former's mistress tries to ease the pain by sucking on it with
evident sexual relish. For the next few scenes, the broken middle
finger sticks up at a provocative angle, as if symbolising Victor's
challenge to the gangsters. The mystery surrounding Victor and
Betty is frequently undercut by their surroundings, which tend to
be banal (the dormobile they travel around in, where there is
barely room to wash up) or kitsch (the Alpine landscapes, the
Swiss hotel, the beach in Guadeloupe). A final shift in tone and a
final celebration of kitsch is provided by the fairytale ending which
takes place, the caption assures us, 'Un siecle plus tard') Pre-
tending to have been crippled by the gangsters, Victor waits in an
isolated Swiss chalet for the arrival of Betty (who is still driving the
trusty dormobile). In a false ending, they exchange a few home
truths before she takes off again. But a moment later, as Betty
listens to a sentimental Michel Jonasz song, she turns round and
returns. The couple are reunited in a romantic embrace and the
credits roll as the song declares 'Changez tout. Qu' est-ce que vous
feriez sans nous?'.4 Like a fairytale of cinema, Chabrol ends his
fiftieth film with a rare happy ending, and a suggestion that he
(and Huppert?) may even be dreaming of a century of film-
making.

Books by Chabrol
Hitchcock, co-written with Eric Rohmer, Paris, ~ditions Universi-
taires, 'Classiques du cinema', 1957. The first book-length study of
Hitchcock, and thus a landmark in auteurist film criticism.
Although Chabrol only wrote the sections on the English films
and on Rebecca, Stage Fright and Notorious, the book reveals his
attitudes to subjects such as film form, subjective narration and
the theme of redemption through love. (Trans. S. Hochman,
Hitchcock: The First Forty-Four Films, New York, Continuum, 1988.)

Et pourtant je toume ... , Paris, Robert Laffont, 1976. An essential
book not just about Chabrol, but about the making of films in
general. Includes autobiography, appreciations of Hitchcock, Lang
and others, a diary of the making of Les Magiciens, anecdotes about
the film business, attacks on censorship and film critics, definitions
of the roles within a film crew, and answers to a questionnaire
about personal likes and dislikes. Recently published by Ramsay
(Poche-Cinema) .

Books on Chabrol
Blanchet, c., Claude Chabrol, Paris, Rivages, 1989. Probably the best
book on Chabrol to date. The first half gives excellent close read-
192   SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY


ings of the films in chronological order. The second half is less
clearly structured, but includes a useful analysis of Chabrol's
influences and his privileging of mise en scene over subject matter.

Braucourt, G., Claude Chabrol, Paris, ~ditions Seghers, Collection
'Cinema d'aujourd'hui, 1971. The excellent closing section pro-
vides an anthology of Chabrol's comments on all aspects of his
work, culled from various interviews. For this reason alone, a very
useful introduction to Chabrol's early and middle periods. But,
like many books on Chabrol, tends to privilege discussions of
psychology over the analysis of mise en scene.

Magny, J., Claude Chabrol, Paris, Cahiers du cinema, Collection
'Auteurs', 1987. Well-informed but surprisingly monotonous work.
Covers many of Chabrol's films up until the mid-eighties, but
reiterates the same (rather obvious) conclusions about Chabrol's
attitudes to power, money, God, the bourgeoisie, etc. A frustrating
tendency to bracket together films from different periods under
obscure title headings, e.g. 'Dieu est mort'. Does at least feature a
long interview with Chabrol and a couple of his early essays as
appendices.

Monaco, J., The New Wave, New York and Oxford, Oxford
University Press, 1976. A review of the new wave which features
one chapter on Chabrol. There is an excellent introduction to his
career and his new wave work. The pace quickens for the seventies
films, each of which is only given a couple of pages or so. The
accounts of the later films remain illuminating but there is less
room for sustained analysis.

Wood, R., and Walker, M., Claude Chabrol, London, Studio Vista,
Movie Paperbacks, 1970. As Walker was to admit in a 1975 article
for Movie magazine, this book is mainly a character-based analysis
ofChabrol's first decade in cinema. There is a strong appreciation
of the treatment of human psychology, murder and the trans-
ference of guilt.
